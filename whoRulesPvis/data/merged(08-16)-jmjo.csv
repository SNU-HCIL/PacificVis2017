1,2008,4475452,Efficient Rendering of Extrudable Curvilinear Volumes,"We present a technique for memory-efficient and time-efficient volume rendering of curvilinear adaptive mesh refinement data defined within extrudable computational spaces. One of the main challenges in the ray casting of curvilinear volumes is that a linear viewing ray in physical space will typically correspond to a curved ray in computational space. The proposed method utilizes a specialized representation of curvilinear space that provides for the compact representation of parameters for transformations between computational space and physical space, without requiring extensive preprocessing. By simplifying the representation of computational space positions using an extrusion of a profile surface, the requisite transformations can be greatly simplified. Our implementation achieves interactive rates with minimal load time and memory overhead using commodity graphics hardware with real-world data.",Steven Martin;Han-Wei Shen;Ravi Samtaney,Ohio State University. e-mail: martinst@cse.ohio-state.edu;Ohio State University. e-mail: hwshen@cse.ohio-state.edu;Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. e-mail: samtaney@pppl.gov,Physics computing;Adaptive mesh refinement;Computer graphics;Casting;Rendering (computer graphics);Hardware;Plasmas;Laboratories;Image generation;Mesh generation,16,1372266;398853;4015501;1372266;398853;4015501;745310;817349;1207442;1250384;1500541;398853;4015486,2,6327236;6684150,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,2008,4475453,Second Order Pre-Integrated Volume Rendering,"In the field of Volume Rendering, the pre-integration of arbitrary transfer functions has certainly led to the most significant and convincing results both quality and performance wise, allowing high quality visualization on standard PC consumer graphics. By showing that the ideal scalar signal along the cast rays is better approximated by a succession of polynomial curves as opposed to linear segments, we propose a new method for pre-integrated volume rendering. This method is based on a second order polynomial interpolation of the scalar values, allowing it to converge more rapidly towards the integration of a volume reconstructed by a trilinear filter. This approach manages to capture the smoothness of the volume's details without the need of further ray resampling, and consequently succeeds in reducing the visual artefacts in comparison to previous techniques. Furthermore, we adapt an existing technique to compute our pre-integration tables using the GPU, thus making our approach suitable for transfer function manipulations.",Jean-Francois El Hajjar;Stephane Marchesin;Jean-Michel Dischler;Catherine Mongenet,"XLIM, University of Limoges. jean-francois.el-hajjar@xlim.fr;LSIIT, University of Strasbourg. marchesin@icps.u-strasbg.fr;LSIIT, University of Strasbourg. dischler@dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr;LSIIT, University of Strasbourg. mongenet@icps.u-strasbg.fr",Rendering (computer graphics);Polynomials;Transfer functions;Computer graphics;Hardware;Visualization;Interpolation;Acceleration;Image reconstruction;Filters,25,1532799;1250412;1250384;1542005;745713;1298797;1226506;885683;885683;1532809;1500541;1250390;675650,9,5540722;6134719;6530590;7314541;5613490;6092707;6532282;6552195,FR;FR;FR;FR,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2008,4475454,Dynamic Shader Generation for Flexible Multi-Volume Visualization,"Volume rendering of multiple intersecting volumetric objects is a difficult visualization task, especially if different rendering styles need to be applied to the components, in order to achieve the desired illustration effect. Real-time performance for even complex scenarios is obtained by exploiting the speed and flexibility of modern GPUs, but at the same time programming the necessary shaders turned into a task for GPU experts only. We foresee the demand for an intermediate level of programming abstraction where visualization specialists can realize advanced applications without the need to deal with shader programming intricacies. In this paper, we describe a generic technique for multi-volume rendering, which generates shader code dynamically from an abstract render graph. By combining pre-defined nodes, complex volume operations can be realized. Our system efficiently creates GPU-based fragment shader and vertex shader programs ""on-the-fly"" to achieve the desired visual results. We demonstrate the flexibility of our technique by applying several dynamically generated volume rendering styles to multi-modal medical datasets.",Friedemann RoBler;Ralf P.

4,2008,4475455,Interactive Exploration of Remote Isosurfaces with Point-Based Non-Photorealistic Rendering,"We present a non-photo realistic rendering technique for interactive exploration of isosurfaces generated from remote volumetric data. Instead of relying on the conventional smooth shading technique to render the isosurfaces, a point-based technique is used to represent and render the isosurfaces in a remote client-server environment. The non-photo realistic nature of the proposed rendering method enables the server to transmit only the essential surface features, which substantially reduces the network traffic. The algorithm also utilizes frame coherence and efficiently encodes the isosurface configuration inside each voxel cell to further minimize the network overhead. Finally, our algorithm can adjust the point distributions using different illumination settings to adapt to different network speeds.",Guangfeng Ji;Han-Wei Shen;Jinzhu Gao,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210; Vital Images, Inc.

6,2008,4475457,Effects of Crossing Angles,"In visualizing graphs as node-link diagrams, it is commonly accepted and employed as a general rule that the number of link crossings should be minimized whenever possible. However, little attention has been paid to how to handle the remaining crossings in the visualization. The study presented in this paper examines the effects of crossing angles on performance of path tracing tasks. It was found that the effect varied with the size of crossing angles. In particular, task response time decreased as the crossing angle increased. However, the rate of the decrease tended to level off when the angle was close to 90 degrees. One of the implications of this study in graph visualization is that just minimizing the crossing number is not sufficient to reduce the negative impact to the minimum. The angles of remaining crossings should be maximized as well.",Weidong Huang;Seok-Hee Hong;Peter Eades,"School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia. e-mail: whua5569@it.usyd.edu.au;School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia. e-mail: shhong@it.usyd.edu.au;School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Australia. e-mail: peter@it.usyd.edu.au",Data visualization;Displays;Algorithm design and analysis;Humans;Information technology;Delay;Law enforcement;Biotechnology;Monitoring;Computational efficiency,21,6312901;6312901,21,5635222;5613439;5429593;6069455;7023568;7785427,AU;AU;AU,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,2008,4475459,Energy-Based Hierarchical Edge Clustering of Graphs,"Effectively visualizing complex node-link graphs which depict relationships among data nodes is a challenging task due to the clutter and occlusion resulting from an excessive amount of edges. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-based hierarchical edge clustering method for node-link graphs. Taking into the consideration of the graph topology, our method first samples graph edges into segments using Delaunay triangulation to generate the control points, which are then hierarchically clustered by energy-based optimization. The edges are grouped according to their positions and directions to improve comprehensibility through abstraction and thus reduce visual clutter. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in clustering edges and providing good high level abstractions of complex graphs.",Hong Zhou;Xiaoru Yuan;Weiwei Cui;Huamin Qu;Baoquan Chen,"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong. e-mail: zhouhong@cse.ust.hk;Peking University, Beijing, China. e-mail: xiaoru.yuan@gmail.com;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong. e-mail: weiwei@cse.ust.hk;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong. e-mail: huamin@cse.ust.hk;The University of Minnesota at Twin Cities, MN, USA. e-mail: baoquan@cs.umn.edu",Cities and towns;Optimization methods;Data visualization;Clustering methods;Topology;Roads;Data structures;Numerical analysis;Computer graphics;Internet,19,4069239;4069239;4015425;1532150;1249008,13,5571244;6636295;6183575;6295796;6596126;6596147;7156354;5887331;6065003;7866170,CN;CN;CN;CN;CN,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,2008,4475460,Finite-Time Transport Structures of Flow Fields,"Modern experimental and computational fluid mechanics are increasingly concerned with the structure nature of fluid motion. Recent research has highlighted the analysis of one transport structure which is called Lagrangian coherent structure. However, the quantity nature of the flow transport is still unclear. In this paper, we focus on the transport characteristics of physical quantities and propose an approach to visualize the finite-time transport structure of quantity advection. This is similar to an integral convolution over a scalar field along path-lines of a flow field. Applied to a well-chosen set of physical quantity fields this yields structures giving insights into the dynamical processes of the underlying flow.

10,2008,4475461,Importance-Driven Particle Techniques for Flow Visualization,"Particle tracing has been established as a powerful visualization technique to show the dynamics of 3D flows. Particle tracing in 3D, however, quickly overextends the viewer due to the massive amount of visual information that is typically produced by this technique. In this paper, we present strategies to reduce this amount at the same time revealing important structures in the flow. As an importance measure, we introduce a simple, yet effective clustering approach for vector fields, and we use scalar flow quantities at different scales in combination with user-defined regions of interest. These measures are used to control the shape, the appearance, and the density of particles in such a way that the user can focus on the dynamics in important regions at the same time preserving context information. We also introduce a new focus for particle tracing, so called anchor lines. Anchor lines are used to analyze local flow features by visualizing how much particles separate over time and how long it takes until they have separated to a fixed distance. It is of particular interest if the finite time Lyapunov exponent - a scalar quantity that measures the rate of separation of infinitesimally close particles in the flow - is used to guide the placement of anchor lines. The effectiveness of our approaches for the visualization of 3D flow fields is validated using synthetic fields as well as real simulation data.",Kai Burger;Polina Kondratieva;Jens Kruger;Rudiger Westermann,"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universit?t M?nchen. kai.buerger@in.tum.de;Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universit?t M?nchen. kondrati@in.tum.de;Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah. mail@jens.krueger.com;Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universit?t M?nchen. westerma@in.tum.de",Data visualization;Computer graphics;Particle measurements;Shape measurement;Time measurement;Shape control;Rendering (computer graphics);Scientific computing;Density measurement;Focusing,32,964403;964403;745317;35197;663912;1512024;346312;809892;4376174;1298800;219449,7,7176865;6468541;5290737;5613499;5557866;5613496,DE;DE;US;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,2008,4475462,Illustrative Streamline Placement and Visualization,"Inspired by the abstracting, focusing and explanatory qualities of diagram drawing in art, in this paper we propose a novel seeding strategy to generate representative and illustrative streamlines in 2D vector fields to enforce visual clarity and evidence. A particular focus of our algorithm is to depict the underlying flow patterns effectively and succinctly with a minimum set of streamlines. To achieve this goal, 2D distance fields are generated to encode the distances from each grid point in the field to the nearby streamlines. A local metric is derived to measure the dissimilarity between the vectors from the original field and an approximate field computed from the distance fields. A global metric is used to measure the dissimilarity between streamlines based on the local errors to decide whether to drop a new seed at a local point. This process is iterated to generate streamlines until no more streamlines can be found that are dissimilar to the existing ones.

12,2008,4475463,Optimizing Parallel Performance of Streamline Visualization for Large Distributed Flow Datasets,"Parallel performance has been a challenging topic in streamline visualization for large unstructured flow datasets on parallel distributed-memory computers. It depends strongly on domain partitions. Unsuitable partitions often lead to severe load imbalance and high frequent communications among the domain partitions. To address the problem, we present an approach to flow data partitioning taking account of flow directions and features. Multilevel spectral graph bisection method is employed to reduce communication and synchronization overhead among distributed domains. Edge weights in the corresponding adjacent matrix is defined based on an anisotropic local diffusion operator which assigns strong coupling along flow direction and weak coupling orthogonal to flow. Meanwhile, the distributions of seed points and flow features such as vortex structure are also considered in partitioning so as to obtain good load balance. The experimental results are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.",Li Chen;Issei Fujishiro,"Institute of Computer Graphics and Computer Aided Design, School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, P.R.

15,2008,4475466,The Event Tunnel: Interactive Visualization of Complex Event Streams for Business Process Pattern Analysis,"Event-based systems are gaining increasing popularity for building loosely coupled and distributed systems. Since business processes are becoming more interconnected and event-driven, event-based systems fit well for supporting and monitoring business processes. In this paper, we present an event-based business intelligence tool, the Event Tunnel framework. It provides an interactive visualization of event streams to support business analysts in exploring business incidents. The visualization is based on the metaphor of considering the event stream as a cylindrical tunnel, which is presented to the user from multiple perspectives. The information of single events laid out in the Event Tunnel is encoded in event glyphs that allow for a selective mapping of event attributes to colors, size and position. Different policies for the placement of the events in the tunnel as well as a clustering mechanism generate various views on historical event data. The Event Tunnel is able to display the relationships between events. This facilitates users to discover root causes and causal dependencies of event patterns. Our framework couples the event-tunnel visualization with query tools that allow users to search for relevant events within a data repository. Using query, filler and highlighting operations the analyst can navigate through the Event Tunnel until the required information or event patterns become visible.

16,2008,4475467,Height Ridge Computation and Filtering for Visualization,"Motivated by the growing interest in the use of ridges in scientific visualization, we analyze the two height ridge definitions by Eberly and Lindeberg. We propose a raw feature definition leading to a superset of the ridge points as obtained by these two definitions. The set of raw feature points has the correct dimensionality, and it can be narrowed down to either Eberly's or Lindeberg's ridges by using Boolean filters which we formulate. While the straight-forward computation of height ridges requires explicit eigenvalue calculation, this can be avoided by using an equivalent definition of the raw feature set, for which we give a derivation. We describe efficient algorithms for two special cases, height ridges of dimension one and of co-dimension one. As an alternative to the aforementioned filters, we propose a new criterion for filtering raw features based on the distance between contours which generally makes better decisions, as we demonstrate on a few synthetic fields, a topographical dataset, and a fluid flow simulation dataset. The same set of test data shows that it is unavoidable to use further filters to eliminate false positives. For this purpose, we use the angle between feature tangent and slope line as a quality measure and, based on this, formalize a previously published filter.",Ronald Peikert;Filip Sadlo,ETH Zurich. e-mail: peikert@inf.ethz.ch;ETH Zurich. e-mail: sadlo@inf.ethz.ch,Filtering;Surface topography;Data visualization;Filters;Computer vision;Integral equations;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Fluid flow;Computational modeling;Testing,27,35197;809896;4376174;4276078;790315,11,5887325;6183582;6327221;4840340;5290735;5613499;6064954;6875965;6327244,CH;CH,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,2008,4475469,Multi-resolution Volume Rendering of Large Time-Varying Data using Video-based Compression,"We present a new framework that combines the hierarchical multi-resolution representation with video-based compression to manage and render large scale time-varying data. In the preprocessing step, the proposed method first constructs a multi-resolution hierarchy using octree structure for each individual time step, and then applies a motion-compensation-based prediction to compress the octree nodes. During rendering stage, the data is decompressed on-the-fly and rendered using hardware texture mapping. The proposed approach eliminates the hierarchical decompression dependency commonly found in the conventional hierarchical wavelet representation methods, which leads to a more efficient reconstruction of data along the time axis.

19,2008,4475470,Interactive Storyboard for Overall Time-Varying Data Visualization,"Large amounts of time-varying datasets create great challenges for users to understand and explore them. This paper proposes an efficient visualization method for observing overall data contents and changes throughout an entire time-varying dataset. We develop an interactive storyboard approach by composing sample volume renderings and descriptive geometric primitives that are generated through data analysis processes. Our storyboard system integrates automatic visualization generation methods and interactive adjustment procedures to provide new tools for visualizing and exploring time-varying datasets. We also provide a flexible framework to quantify data differences and automatically select representative datasets through exploring scientific data distribution features. Since this approach reduces the visualized data amount into a more understandable size and format for users, it can be used to effectively visualize, represent, and explore a large time-varying dataset. Initial user study results show that our approach shortens the exploration time and reduces the number of datasets that users visualized individually. This visualization method is especially useful for situations that require close observance or are not capable of interactive rendering, such as documentation and demonstration.",Aidong Lu;Han-Wei Shen,University of North Carolina at Charlotte. e-mail: aidong.lu@uncc.edu;The Ohio State University. e-mail: hwshen@cis.ohio-state.edu,Data visualization;Data analysis;Feature extraction;Time varying systems;Computer graphics;Documentation;Information analysis;Shadow mapping;Acceleration;Rendering (computer graphics),35,468404;468404;4015469;1238382;885703;1250374;1532857;1240860;299407;597796;1541996;1333660;4015449;710733,10,6064965;6875981;6875941;6378975;6062784;6094055;7539644;5232780;6596138,US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide concrete examples of applying animation to combat such limitations for four common visualization types: geospatial data, treemaps, parallel coordinate displays, and large graphs. Unlike previous work which examines animation for maintaining user orientation during view changes or for displaying data variables, we discuss animation's utility for multiplexing available screen space.

Our design builds upon the treemap layout and the stacked graph to contribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interacting with the hierarchical data of NSF programs and proposals, supporting visual search and analysis, and allowing the user to make informed decision. In this visualization toolkit, we propose two visualization techniques to simplify the navigation of the hierarchical data: 2.5 Dimensional treemaps to make the hierarchical structure more easily to be recognized, and labeled treemap to help the user to get a clear overview of the content of the structure and make the internal area of rectangles correspond to the weights of the data set. Furthermore, an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large scale. The improved treemap visualization will help to visually analyze the static funding data and the stacked graph is utilized to analyze the time-series data.

26,2008,4475477,Map Warping for the Annotation of Metro Maps,"We augment schematic maps of transportation systems by superimposing them on street-level maps that are fitted using image warping techniques. While schematic maps are successful in conveying information about lines and connections in a public transportation network, they usually contain little or no detail describing the environment of stations or their embedding in the surrounding area. The annotation of a distorted city map therefore alleviates this deficiency and improves further the usability of schematic transportation maps by merging two different navigational spaces. Our technique for fitting the street map to the schematic map is based on moving least squares in combination with an overlap control technique. We thus obtain an easily readable transportation network map on which we can show all the typical city map features such as rivers, streets, and parks without compromising on the schematization.

In this paper, we present a new technique to determine the layout of a multivariate network using geodesic self-organizing map (GeoSOM). During the training process of a GeoSOM, graph distances are non-linearly combined with attribute similarities based on the network's graph distance distribution. The resulted layout has less edge crossings than those generated by the previous methods. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach. The results were compared against the most commonly used glyph-based technique. The user study shows that the hybrid approach helps users draw conclusions from both the relationship and vertex attributes of a multivariate network more quickly and accurately.

30,2008,4475481,A Treemap Based Method for Rapid Layout of Large Graphs,"Abstract graphs or networks are a commonly recurring data type in many fields. In order to visualize such graphs effectively, the graph must be laid out on the screen coherently. Many algorithms exist to do this, but many of these algorithms tend to be very slow when the input graph is large. This paper presents a new approach to the large graph layout problem, which quickly generates an effective layout. This new method proceeds by generating a clustering hierarchy for the graph, applying a treemap to this hierarchy, and finally placing the graph vertices in their associated regions in the treemap. It is ideal for interactive systems where operations such as semantic zooming are to be performed, since most of the work is done in the initial hierarchy calculation, and it takes very little work to recalculate the layout. This method is also valuable in that the resulting layout can be used as the input to an iterative algorithm (e.g., a force directed method), which greatly reduces the number of iterations required to converge to a near optimal layout.",Chris Muelder;Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California, Davis. muelder@cs.ucdavis.edu;University of California, Davis. ma@cs.ucdavis.edu",Tree graphs;Layout;Iterative algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data visualization;Interactive systems;Testing;Acceleration;Hardware,28,4015425;1532128;4015425;1532128;4376155;1432691;1382934;1532063;1532129,13,6576786;7539318;6295796;6295786;7156357;4658143;7390081;7156355;4906846,US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,2009,4906831,Visualizing time-varying features with TAC-based distance fields,"To analyze time-varying data sets, tracking features over time is often necessary to better understand the dynamic nature of the underlying physical process. Tracking 3D time-varying features, however, is non-trivial when the boundaries of the features cannot be easily defined. In this paper, we propose a new framework to visualize time-varying features and their motion without explicit feature segmentation and tracking. In our framework, a time-varying feature is described by a time series or Time Activity Curve (TAC). To compute the distance, or similarity, between a voxel's time series and the feature, we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance metric. The purpose of DTW is to compare the shape similarity between two time series with an optimal warping of time so that the phase shift of the feature in time can be accounted for. After applying DTW to compare each voxel's time series with the feature, a time-invariant distance field can be computed. The amount of time warping required for each voxel to match the feature provides an estimate of the time when the feature is most likely to occur. Based on the TAC-based distance field, several visualization methods can be derived to highlight the position and motion of the feature. We present several case studies to demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of our framework.",Teng-Yok Lee;Han-Wei Shen,"The Ohio State University, USA;The Ohio State University, USA",Data visualization;Shape;Data analysis;Earthquakes;Space exploration;Tracking;Animation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Spatiotemporal phenomena,34,4376176;964531;1250374;1532857;1056489;4384038;485141;809910;567807;745288;1532858;5487517;4658174;998752;4515862;1250402;1500520,18,6378975;6327206;5290749;6596138,US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,2009,4906833,Interactive feature extraction and tracking by utilizing region coherency,"The ability to extract and follow time-varying flow features in volume data generated from large-scale numerical simulations enables scientists to effectively see and validate modeled phenomena and processes. Extracted features often take much less storage space and computing resources to visualize. Most feature extraction and tracking methods first identify features of interest in each time step independently, then correspond these features in consecutive time steps of the data. Since these methods handle each time step separately, they do not use the coherency of the feature along the time dimension in the extraction process. In this paper, we present a prediction-correction method that uses a prediction step to make the best guess of the feature region in the subsequent time step, followed by growing and shrinking the border of the predicted region to coherently extract the actual feature of interest. This method makes use of the temporal-space coherency of the data to accelerate the extraction process while implicitly solving the tedious correspondence problem that previous methods focus on. Our method is low cost with very little storage overhead, and thus facilitates interactive or runtime extraction and visualization, unlike previous methods which were largely suited for batch-mode processing due to high computational cost.",Chris Muelder;Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California, Davis, USA;University of California, Davis, USA",Feature extraction;Data mining;Data visualization;Acceleration;Computer graphics;Computational modeling;Application software;Large-scale systems;Numerical simulation;Costs,27,885704;885704;1372214;1238277;1250374;398901;299407;1250369;597796;745288;400573;5487517;729591;1250402,34,6378982;7348065;5307638;5728946;6269875;6378976;5290763;6583163;6143934;7348067;6875975;6185542;7192664,US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,2009,4906837,Toward effective insight management in visual analytics systems,"Although significant progress has been made toward effective insight discovery in visual sense making approaches, there is a lack of effective and efficient approaches to manage the large amounts of insights discovered. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage this problem around the concept of facts. Facts refer to patterns, relationships, or anomalies extracted from data under analysis. They are the direct products of visual exploration and permit construction of insights together with user's mental model and evaluation. Different from the mental model, the type of facts that can be discovered from data is predictable and application-independent. Thus it is possible to develop a general Fact Management Framework (FMF) to allow visualization users to effectively and efficiently annotate, browse, retrieve, associate, and exchange facts. Since facts are essential components of insights, it will be feasible to extend FMF to effective insight management in a variety of visual analytics approaches. Toward this goal, we first construct a fact taxonomy that categorizes various facts in multidimensional data and captures their essential attributes through extensive literature survey and user studies. We then propose a conceptual framework of fact management based upon this fact taxonomy. A concrete scenario of visual sense making on real data sets illustrates how this FMF will work.",Yang Chen;Jing Yang;William Ribarsky,"Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, USA;Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, USA;Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, USA",Visual analytics;Cognitive science;Data visualization;Data analysis;Taxonomy;Collaboration;Data mining;Pattern analysis;Multidimensional systems;Decision making,34,1532136;1532136;4677362;1382915;4677365;4035747;890621;1626178;4272054;4677358;1703371;545307;4376131;146375;1703359;4035754,30,6327280;5482578;6102447,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2009,4906838,Visual support for the understanding of simulation processes,"Current visualization systems are typically based on the concept of interactive post-processing. This decoupling of data visualization from the process of data generation offers a flexible application of visualization tools. It can also lead, however, to information loss in the visualization. Therefore, a combination of the visualization of the data generating process with the visualization of the produced data offers significant support for the understanding of the abstract data sets as well as the underlying process. Due to the application-specific characteristics of data generating processes, the task requires tailored visualization concepts. In this work, we focus on the application field of simulating biochemical reaction networks as discrete-event systems. These stochastic processes generate multi-run and multivariate time-series, which are analyzed and compared on three different process levels: model, experiment, and the level of multi-run simulation data, each associated with a broad range of analysis goals. To meet these challenging characteristics, we present visualization concepts specifically tailored to all three process levels. The fundament of all three visualization concepts is a compact view that relates the multi-run simulation data to the characteristics of the model structure and the experiment. The view provides the visualization at the experiment level. The visualization at the model level coordinates multiple instances of this view for the comparison of experiments. At the level of multi-run simulation data, the views gives an overview on the data, which can be analyzed in detail in time-series views suited for the analysis goals. Although we derive our visualization concepts for one concrete simulation process, our general concept of tailoring the visualization concepts to process levels is generally applicable for the visualization of simulation processes.",Andrea Unger;Heidrun Schumann,"University of Rostock, Germany;University of Rostock, Germany",Data visualization;Biological system modeling;Information analysis;Data analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Character generation;Discrete event systems;Stochastic processes;Time series analysis,15,4117796;4117796;1532821;1334987;4577975;4577953,30,6327226;6634085;6876043;6634188;6185547;6465310,DE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,2009,4906839,"Optimized data transfer for time-dependent, GPU-based glyphs","Particle-based simulations are a popular tool for researchers in various sciences. In combination with the availability of ever larger COTS clusters and the consequently increasing number of simulated particles the resulting datasets pose a challenge for real-time visualization. Additionally the semantic density of the particles exceeds the possibilities of basic glyphs, like splats or spheres and results in dataset sizes larger by at least an order of magnitude. Interactive visualization on common workstations requires a careful optimization of the data management, especially of the transfer between CPU and GPU. We propose a flexible benchmarking tool along with a series of tests to allow the evaluation of the performance of different CPU/GPU combinations in relation to a particular implementation. We evaluate different uploading strategies and rendering methods for point-based compound glyphs suitable for representing the aforementioned datasets. CPU and GPU-based approaches are compared with respect to their rendering and storage efficiency to point out the optimal solution when dealing with time-dependent datasets. The results of our research are of general interest since they can be transferred to other applications where CPU-GPU bandwidth and a high number of graphical primitives per dataset pose a problem.

10,2009,4906840,Out-of-core volume rendering for time-varying fields using a space-partitioning time (SPT) tree,"In this paper, we propose a novel out-of-core volume rendering algorithm for large time-varying fields. Exploring temporal and spatial coherences has been an important direction for speeding up the rendering of time-varying data. Previously, there were techniques that hierarchically partition both the time and space domains into a data structure so as to re-use some results from the previous time step in multiresolution rendering; however, it has not been studied on which domain should be partitioned first to obtain a better re-use rate. We address this open question, and show both theoretically and experimentally that partitioning the time domain first is better. We call the resulting structure (a binary time tree as the primary structure and an octree as the secondary structure) the space-partitioning time (SPT) tree. Typically, our SPT-tree rendering has a higher level of details, a higher re-use rate, and runs faster. In addition, we devise a novel cut-finding algorithm to facilitate efficient out-of-core volume rendering using our SPT tree, we develop a novel out-of-core preprocessing algorithm to build our SPT tree I/O-efficiently, and we propose modified error metrics with a theoretical guarantee of a monotonicity property that is desirable for the tree search.

In this canonical matrix, nodes are ordered based on a Breadth-First Search spanning tree. Special rules and filters are designed to guarantee the uniqueness of an arrangement.

An appropriate contrast between symbols is a precondition that determines the efficiency of a visual analysis process. We study the contrast between different types of symbols in the context of scatterplots, based on user testing and a quantitative model for symbol contrast. In total, 32 different symbols were generated by using four sizes, two classes (polygon-and asterisk shaped), and four categories of rotational symmetry; and used three different tasks. From the user test results an internal separation space is established for the symbol types under study. In this space, every symbol is represented by a point, and the visual contrasts defined by task performance between the symbols are represented by the distances between the points. The positions of the points in the space, obtained by Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), reveal the effects of different visual feature scales. Also, larger distances imply better symbol separation for visual tasks, and therefore indicate appropriate choices for symbols. The resulting configurations are discussed, and a number of patterns in the relation between properties of the symbols and the resulting contrast are identified. In short we found that the size effect in the space is not linear and more dominant than shape effect.",Jing Li;Jarke J. van Wijk;Jean-Bernard Martens,"Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands;Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands;Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands",Scattering;Testing;Humans;Visual perception;Data visualization;Context modeling;Multidimensional systems;Shape;Encoding;Probability,32,1532136,8,6484064;5429604;6875982,NL;NL;NL,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These approaches detect features globally in the data and place these features inside levels of a hierarchy. However, this feature detection is a global process and does not consider nodes of the graph near a feature of interest. TugGraph is a system for exploring paths and proximity around nodes and subgraphs in a graph. The approach modifies a pre-existing hierarchy in order to see how a node or subgraph of interest extends out into the larger graph. It is guaranteed to create path-preserving hierarchies, so that the abstraction shown is meaningful with respect to the structure of the graph. The system works well on graphs of hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges.

However, our practical experience shows that in many cases, layout quality suffers as a result of non-uniform vertex density. This gives rise to warping effects in that vertices on the outskirt of the drawing are often closer to each other than those near the center, and branches in a tree-like graph tend to cling together. In this paper we propose algorithms that overcome these effects.

18,2009,4906848,A graph reading behavior: Geodesic-path tendency,"The end result of graph visualization is that people read the graph and understand the data. To make this effective, it is essential to construct visualizations based on how people read graphs. Despite the popularity and importance of graph usage in a variety of application domains, little is known about how people read graphs. The lack of this knowledge has severely limited the effectiveness of graph visualizations. In attempts to understand how people read graphs, we previously observed that people have geodesic-path tendency based on subjective eye tracking data. This paper presents two controlled experiments. One is to approve the existence of the geodesic-path tendency. The other is to examine the effects of this tendency on people in reading graphs. The results show that in performing path search tasks, when eyes encounter a node that has more than one link, links that go toward the target node are more likely to be searched first. The results also indicate that when graphs are drawn with branch links on the path leading away from the target node, graph reading performance can be significantly improved.",Weidong Huang;Peter Eades;Seok-Hee Hong,"Australian Council for Educational Research, Australia;University of Sydney, Australia;University of Sydney, Australia",Data visualization;Psychology;Humans;Testing;Australia Council;Eyes;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational efficiency;Performance evaluation;Shape,15,1382886;1382886;841119;4126225,44,7851166;6298350;7388003;6878731;5429593;6596142;7192646,AU;AU;AU,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,2009,4906849,Visualizing diffusion tensor imaging data with merging ellipsoids,"Diffusion tensor fields reveal the underlying anatomical structures in biological tissues such as neural fibers in the brain. Most current methods for visualizing the diffusion tensor field can be categorized into two classes: integral curves and glyphs. Integral curves are continuous and represent the underlying fiber structures, but are prone to integration error and loss of local information. Glyphs are useful for representing local tensor information, but do not convey the connectivity in the anatomical structures well. We introduce a simple yet effective visualization technique that extends the streamball method in flow visualization to tensor ellipsoids. Each tensor ellipsoid represents a local tensor, and either blends with neighboring tensors or breaks away from them depending on their orientations and anisotropies. The resulting visualization shows the connectivity information in the underlying anatomy while characterizing the local tenors in detail. By interactively changing an iso-value parameter, users can examine the diffusion tensor field in the entire spectrum between the continuous integral curves and the discrete glyphs. Expert evaluation indicates that this method conveys very useful visual information about local anisotropy in white matter fibers. Such information was previously unavailable in tractography models.

The high number of objects in a simulation requires advanced visualization techniques: first to handle the large data sets, second to support the human perception in the crowded environment, and third to provide an interactive exploration tool. To adjust the state of the cell to an external signal, a specific set of signaling molecules transports the information to the nucleus deep inside the cell. There, key molecules regulate gene expression. In contrast to continuous ODE models we model all signaling molecules individually in a more realistic crowded and disordered environment. Beyond spatiotemporal concentration profiles our data describes the process on a mesoscopic, molecular level, allowing a detailed view of intracellular events. In our proposed schematic visualization individual molecules, their tracks, or reactions can be selected and brought into focus to highlight the signal transduction pathway. Segmentation, depth cues and depth of field are applied to reduce the visual complexity. We also provide a virtual microscope to display images for comparison with wet lab experiments.

23,2009,4906854,Visibility-driven transfer functions,"Direct volume rendering is an important tool for visualizing complex data sets. However, in the process of generating 2D images from 3D data, information is lost in the form of attenuation and occlusion. The lack of a feedback mechanism to quantify the loss of information in the rendering process makes the design of good transfer functions a difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, we present the notion of visibility-driven transfer functions, which are transfer functions that provide a good visibility of features of interest from a given viewpoint. To achieve this, we introduce visibility histograms. These histograms provide graphical cues that intuitively inform the user about the contribution of particular scalar values to the final image. By carefully manipulating the parameters of the opacity transfer function, users can now maximize the visibility of the intervals of interest in a volume data set. Based on this observation, we also propose a semi-automated method for generating transfer functions, which progressively improves a transfer function defined by the user, according to a certain importance metric. Now the user does not have to deal with the tedious task of making small changes to the transfer function parameters, but now he/she can rely on the system to perform these searches automatically. Our methodology can be easily deployed in most visualization systems and can be used together with traditional 1D opacity transfer functions based on scalar values, as well as with multidimensional transfer functions and other more sophisticated rendering algorithms.",Carlos D.

In clinical diagnostics the points of interest are often located in the center of anatomical structures. In order to derive the volumetric position which allows a convenient examination of the intended structure, the system automatically extracts contextual meta information from the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) images and the setup of the medical workstation. Along a viewing ray for a volumetric picking, the ray profile is analyzed for structures which are similar to predefined templates from a knowledge base. We demonstrate with our results that the obtained position in 3D can be utilized to highlight a structure in 2D slice views, to interactively calculate centerlines of tubular objects, or to place labels at contextually-defined volumetric positions.",Peter Kohlmann;Stefan Bruckner;Armin Kanitsar;M.

25,2009,4906856,Structure-aware viewpoint selection for volume visualization,"Viewpoint selection is becoming a useful part in the volume visualization pipeline, as it further improves the efficiency of data understanding by providing representative viewpoints. We present two structure-aware view descriptors, which are the shape view descriptor and the detail view descriptor, to select the optimal viewpoint with the maximum amount of the structural information. These two proposed structure-aware view descriptors are both based on the gradient direction, as the gradient is a well-defined measurement of boundary structures, which have been proved as features of interest in many applications. The shape view descriptor is designed to evaluate the overall orientation of features of interest. For estimating local details, we employ the bilateral filter to construct the shape volume. The bilateral filter is very effective in smoothing local details and preserving strong boundary structures at the same time. Therefore, large-scale global structures are in the shape volume, while small-scale local details still remain in the original volume. The detail view descriptor measures the amount of visible details on boundary structures in terms of variances in the local structure between the shape volume and the original volume. These two view descriptors can be integrated into a viewpoint selection framework, and this framework can emphasize global structures or local details with flexibility tailored to the user's specific situations. We performed experiments on various types of volume datasets. These experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed view descriptors, and the proposed viewpoint selection framework actually locates the optimal viewpoints that show the maximum amount of the structural information.",Yubo Tao;Hai Lin;Hujun Bao;Feng Dong;Gordon Clapworthy,"State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China;State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China;State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, China;University of Bedfordshire, UK;University of Bedfordshire, UK",Rendering (computer graphics);Filters;Pipelines;Smoothing methods;Data visualization;Large-scale systems;Volume measurement;Shape measurement;Computer graphics;Data mining,28,1532833;1532833;937526;4015471;729588;4376185;9032;1372209;1246940;56205;1532834;710815;1580455,21,6689411;7467246,CN;CN;CN;GB;GB,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effectiveness of the results, especially direct volume rendered images, is difficult to validate and users may not be aware of ambiguous or even misleading information in the results. This limits the applications of volume visualization. In this paper, we introduce four quantitative effectiveness measures: distinguishability, contour clarity, edge consistency, and depth coherence measures, which target different effectiveness issues for direct volume rendered images.

2,2010,5429624,Shape-based transfer functions for volume visualization,"We present a novel classification technique for volume visualization that takes the shape of volumetric features into account. The presented technique enables the user to distinguish features based on their 3D shape and to assign individual optical properties to these. Based on a rough pre-segmentation that can be done by windowing, we exploit the curve-skeleton of each volumetric structure in order to derive a shape descriptor similar to those used in current shape recognition algorithms. The shape descriptor distinguishes three main shape classes: longitudinal, surface-like, and blobby shapes. In contrast to previous approaches, the classification is not performed on a per-voxel level but assigns a uniform shape descriptor to each feature and therefore allows a more intuitive user interface for the assignment of optical properties. By using the proposed technique, it becomes for instance possible to distinguish blobby heart structures filled with contrast agents from potentially occluding vessels and rib bones.

These properties are used to define a transfer-function space which enables the distinction of different materials. Additionally, we present a novel approach for interacting with our new transfer-function space which enables the design of transfer functions based on statistical properties.

We introduce a method for supporting this kind of multi-focus interaction that we call stack zooming. The approach is based on the user interactively building hierarchies of 1D strips stacked on top of each other, where each subsequent stack represents a higher zoom level, and sibling strips represent branches in the visual exploration. Correlation graphics show the relation between stacks and strips of different levels, providing context and distance awareness among the focus points. The zoom hierarchies can also be used as graphical histories and for communicating insights to stakeholders.

8,2010,5429609,Caleydo: Design and evaluation of a visual analysis framework for gene expression data in its biological context,"The goal of our work is to support experts in the process of hypotheses generation concerning the roles of genes in diseases. For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably.

9,2010,5429610,Visualizing field-measured seismic data,"This paper presents visualization of field-measured, time-varying multidimensional earthquake accelerograph readings. Direct volume rendering is used to depict the space-time relationships of seismic readings collected from sensor stations in an intuitive way such that the progress of seismic wave propagation of an earthquake event can be directly observed. The resulting visualization reveals the sequence of seismic wave initiation, propagation, attenuation over time, and energy releasing events. We provide a case study on the magnitude scale Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, which is the most thoroughly recorded earthquake event ever in the history. More than 400 stations recorded this event, and the readings from this event increased global strong-motion records five folds. Each station measured east-west, north-south, and vertical component of acceleration for approximately 90 seconds. The sensor network released the initial raw data within minutes after the Chi-Chi mainshock. It is essential to have a visualization system for fast data exploring and analyzing, offering crucial visual analytical information for scientists to make quick judgments. Raw data requires preprocessing before it can be rendered. We generated a sequence of ground-motion wave-field maps of 350  200 regular grid covers the entire Taiwan island from the sensor network readings. The result is a total of 1000 ground-motion wave-field maps with 0.1 second interval, forming a 1000  350  200 volume data set.

12,2010,5429602,CycleStack: Inferring periodic behavior via temporal sequence visualization in ultrasound video,"A range of well-known treatment methods for destroying tumor and similar harmful growth in human body utilizes the coherence between the inherently periodic movement of the affected body part and periodic respiratory signal of the patient, with the objective of minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues. Such methods require constant monitoring by an operator who observes the 3D body motion via its 2D projection onto an ultrasound imaging plane and studies the synchronism of this motion with the respiratory signal. Keeping an attentive eye on the respiratory signal as well as the ultrasound video for the entire treatment period is often inconvenient and burdensome. In this paper, we propose a video visualization technique called CycleStack Plot which reduces this cognitive overhead by blending the video and the signal together in a stack-like layout. This visualization reveals the inherent synchronism between the target's movement and the respiratory signal, visually highlights significant phase shifts of either of the two cyclic phenomena, with the hope of arresting the operator's attention. Our proposed visualization also provides a visual overview for the post-treatment analysis which enables educated users to quickly and effectively skim through the excessively long process. This paper demonstrates the utility of CycleStack Plot with a case study using real ultrasound videos. In addition, a user study has been performed to evaluate the merits and limitations of the proposed method with respect to the conventional way of watching a video and a signal side-by-side.

Sixteen subjects divided in two groups, participated in the experiment and their task performance times were recorded. We propose a model to describe the process. The perception of lightness is assumed to be an early step in the complex cognitive process to mediate discrimination, and psychophysical laws are used to describe this perceptual mapping. Different mapping schemes are compared by regression on the experimental data. The results show that approximate homogeneity of lightness perception exists in our complex tasks and can be closely described by a blended combination of two opposite power functions assuming either the light end or the dark end of the lightness scale as the starting point. The model further yields discriminability scales of lightness for sparse scatterplots with a white background.",Jing Li;Jarke J. van Wijk;Jean-Bernard Martens,"Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands;Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands;Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands",Light scattering;Psychology;Visual analytics;Humans;Testing;Data visualization;Data analysis;Information analysis;Frequency;Appropriate technology,27,568118;7760;4906843,2,6484064;6634120,NL;NL;NL,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,2010,5429601,Visual analysis of high dimensional point clouds using topological landscapes,"In this paper, we present a novel three-stage process to visualize the structure of point clouds in arbitrary dimensions. To get insight into the structure and complexity of a data set, we would most preferably just look into it, e.g. by plotting its corresponding point cloud. Unfortunately, for orthogonal scatter plots, this only works up to three dimensions, and other visualizations, like parallel coordinates or scatterplot matrices, also have problems handling many dimensions and visual overlap of data entities. The presented solution tackles the problem of visualizing point clouds indirectly by visualizing the topology of their density distribution. The benefit of this approach is that this topology can be computed in arbitrary dimensions. Similar to examining scatter plots, this gives the important information like the number, size and nesting structure of accumulated regions. We view our approach as an alternative to cluster visualization. To create the visualization, we first estimate the density function using a novel high-dimensional interpolation scheme. Second, we compute that function's topology by means of the join tree, generate a corresponding 3-D terrain using the topological landscape metaphor introduced by Weber et al. (2007), and finally augment that landscape by placing the original data points at suitable locations.",Patrick Oesterling;Christian Heine;Heike J?nicke;Gerik Scheuermann,"University of Leipzig, Germany;University of Leipzig, Germany;Swansea University, UK;University of Leipzig, Germany",Clouds;Data visualization;Topology;Scattering;Pattern recognition;Density functional theory;Interpolation;Clustering algorithms;Design methodology;Pattern analysis,37,4658123;146402;163414;485140;489388;5290728;4376169,27,6064953;6327232;7014764;5613467;5652940,DE;DE;GB;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we use a trend chart to encode the overall semantic evolution of document content over time. In our work, semantic evolution of a document collection is modeled by varied significance of document content, represented by a set of representative keywords, at different time points. At each time point, we also use a word cloud to depict the representative keywords. Since the words in a word cloud may vary one from another over time (e.g., words with increased importance), we use geometry meshes and an adaptive force-directed model to lay out word clouds to highlight the word differences between any two subsequent word clouds. Our method also ensures semantic coherence and spatial stability of word clouds over time. Our work is embodied in an interactive visual analysis system that helps users to perform text analysis and derive insights from a large collection of documents.

One challenge is to find and classify the representative field lines. Most existing solutions follow an automatic approach that generates field lines characterizing the flow and arranges these lines into a single picture. In our work, we advocate a user-centric approach to exploring 3D vector fields. Our method allows the user to sketch 2D curves for pattern matching in 2D and field lines clustering in 3D. Specifically, a 3D field line whose view-dependent 2D projection is most similar to the user drawing will be identified and utilized to extract all similar 3D field lines. Furthermore, we employ an automatic clustering method to generate field-line templates for the user to locate subfields of interest. This semi-automatic process leverages the user's knowledge about the flow field through intuitive user interaction, resulting in a promising alternative to existing flow visualization solutions. With our sketch-based interface, the user can effectively dissect the flow field and make more structured visualization for analysis or presentation.",Jishang Wei;Chaoli Wang;Hongfeng Yu;Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California, Davis, USA;Michigan Technological University, USA;Sandia National Laboratories, USA;University of California, Davis, USA",Data visualization;Clustering algorithms;Character generation;Clustering methods;Pattern analysis;Chaos;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Design engineering;Engines,23,4376173;4376173;809863;4475462;4135666;809865;4270121;885690;55108,28,6092316;6596153;7176865;6468541;6613495;7117453;6596150;7429510;7534876;6787131;6634122,US;US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key point of the method is to use a flow dependent reaction source which couples advection and reaction dynamics. When embedded in semi-Lagrangian advection this reaction source provides systematic pattern generation and integration along pathlines. Based on this idea and a very simple equation with a stable and efficient numerical solution, a visualization model is developed which allows visualization of both Lagrangian and Eulerian structures in a flexible environment and with user control.

19,2010,5429599,Physically-based interactive schlieren flow visualization,"Understanding fluid flow is a difficult problem and of increasing importance as computational fluid dynamics produces an abundance of simulation data. Experimental flow analysis has employed techniques such as shadowgraph and schlieren imaging for centuries which allow empirical observation of inhomogeneous flows. Shadowgraphs provide an intuitive way of looking at small changes in flow dynamics through caustic effects while schlieren cutoffs introduce an intensity gradation for observing large scale directional changes in the flow. The combination of these shading effects provides an informative global analysis of overall fluid flow. Computational solutions for these methods have proven too complex until recently due to the fundamental physical interaction of light refracting through the flow field. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to simulate the refraction of light to generate synthetic shadowgraphs and schlieren images of time-varying scalar fields derived from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. Our method computes physically accurate schlieren and shadowgraph images at interactive rates by utilizing a combination of GPGPU programming, acceleration methods, and data-dependent probabilistic schlieren cutoffs.

This is achieved by representing the time dimension of each animation sequence with a sequential curve in a locality-preserving reference 2D space, called the motion track representation. The principal advantage of this representation over standard representations of motion capture data - generally either a keyframed timeline or a 2D motion map in its entirety - is that it maps the motion differences along the time dimension into parallel perceptible spatial dimensions but at the same time captures the primary content of the source data.

A complex, high-frequency structure is locally encoded into the mesh on-the-fly based on the user's volume of interest.

By approximating light transport in inhomogeneous participating media, we are able to come up with an efficient GPU implementation, in order to achieve the desired effects at interactive frame rates. Moreover, in many cases the frame rates are even higher as those achieved with conventional gradient-based shading. To evaluate the impact of the proposed illumination model on the spatial comprehension of volumetric objects, we have conducted a user study, in which the participants had to perform depth perception tasks. The results of this study show, that depth perception is significantly improved when comparing our illumination model to conventional gradient-based volume shading. Additionally, since our volumetric illumination model is not based on gradient calculation, it is also less sensitive to noise and therefore also applicable to imaging modalities incorporating a higher degree of noise, as for instance magnet resonance tomography or 3D ultrasound.",Timo Ropinski;Christian D?ring;Christof Rezk-Salama,"University of M?nster, Germany;European Institue of Molecular Imaging (EIMI), Germany;Mediadesign University of Applied Sciences, D?sseldorf, Germany",Light scattering;Shadow mapping;Lighting;Resonance light scattering;Computed tomography;Ultrasonic imaging;Computer graphics;Mice;Visualization;Magnetic separation,29,729583;729583;1183764;1196003;468400;4392752;1250394;1196002,48,5928339;6175015;6875905;7064413;5710905;6327241;7156383;7874309;6064977;6064955;6634193;6634150;7194844;6461883;6064942,DE;DE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This representation is a multi-layered image, or an explorable image, which enables interactive exploration of volume data in transfer function space without accessing the original data. We achieve this by automatically extracting layers depicted in composited images. The layers can then be recombined in different ways to simulate opacity changes and recoloring of individual features. Our results demonstrate that explorable images are especially useful when the volume data is too large for interactive exploration, takes too long to render due to the underlying mesh structure or desired shading effect, or if the original volume data is not available.

24,2010,5429592,Crossing-free many-to-one boundary labeling with hyperleaders,"In boundary labeling, each point site is uniquely connected to a label placed on the boundary of an enclosing rectangle by a leader, which may be a rectilinear or straight line segment. Most of the results reported in the literature for boundary labeling deal with the so-called one-to-one boundary labeling, i.e., different sites are labelled differently. In certain applications of boundary labeling, however, more than one site may be required to be connected to a common label. In this case, the presence of crossings among leaders often becomes inevitable such that the labeling often has a high degree of confusion in visualization. In this paper, for multi-site-to-one-label boundary labeling, crossings among leaders are avoided by substituting hyperleaders for leaders and by applying dummy labels (i.e., copies/duplicates of labels). Minimizing the number of dummy labels becomes a critical design issue as dummy labels are not required in the initial setting. Therefore, we consider the problem of minimizing the number of dummy labels for multi-site-to-one-label boundary labeling, i.e., finding the placements of labels and hyperleaders such that the total number of dummy labels is minimized and there are no crossings among hyperleaders. Furthermore, after the number of dummy labels is determined, minimizing the total hyperleader length as well as the bends of hyperleaders is also concerned in postprocessing procedure. In this paper, we present polynomial time algorithms for the above one-side and two-side labeling schemes, and show their correctness from a theoretical point of view. In addition, we provide a simulated annealing algorithm for the four-side labeling schemes with objective to minimize the total number of dummy labels as well as the total leader length. Experimental results show that our four-side solutions look promising, as compared to the optimal solutions.",Chun-Cheng Lin,"Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Taiwan 807, R.O.C.",Labeling;Visualization;Universal Serial Bus;Power supplies;Local area networks;Batteries;Computer science;Polynomials;Simulated annealing;Connectors,11,,17,6676548;6787174,TW,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper extends existing measures of conceptual Web site traffic analysis and describes a system, called COWA, that supports this analysis by means of network models and graph visualization technologies. The graph drawing algorithmic core of the user interface of COWA is a force directed heuristic that computes a simultaneous embedding of two non-planar graphs.

By exploiting this approach hybrid-visualization tools can effectively combine different node-link and matrix-based representations, allowing the users to interactively explore the graph by expansion/contraction of clusters without loosing their mental map.

Although it provides an intuitive way to inspect the overall structure of objects of interest, an in-detail inspection can be tedious - or when cavities occur even impossible. Therefore we propose a context-aware navigation technique for the exploration of volumetric data. While navigation techniques for polygonal data require information about the rendered geometry, this strategy is not sufficient in the area of volume rendering. Since rendering parameters, e.g., the transfer function, have a strong influence on the visualized structures, they also affect the features to be explored. To compensate for this effect we propose a novel image-based navigation approach for volumetric data. While being intuitive to use, the proposed technique allows the user to perform complex navigation tasks, in particular to get an overview as well as to perform an in-detail inspection without any navigation mode switches. The technique can be easily integrated into raycasting based volume renderers, needs no extra data structures and is independent of the data set as well as the rendering parameters.

This paper addresses the issue of creating a static volume classification that summarizes the correlation connection in time-varying multivariate data sets. In practice, computing all temporal and spatial correlations for large 3D time-varying multivariate data sets is prohibitively expensive. We present a sampling-based approach to classifying correlation patterns. Our sampling scheme consists of three steps: selecting important samples from the volume, prioritizing distance computation for sample pairs, and approximating volume-based correlation with sample-based correlation. We classify sample voxels to produce static visualization that succinctly summarize the connection among all correlation volumes with respect to various reference locations. We also investigate the error introduced by each step of our sampling scheme in terms of classification accuracy.

In this paper, we will introduce our recent endeavor, the Neuron Navigator (NNG), which integrates a 3D neuron image database into an easy-to-use visual interface. Via a flexible and user-friendly interface, NNG is designed to help researchers analyze and observe the connectivity within the neural maze and discover possible pathways. With NNG's 3D neuron image database, researchers can perform volumetric searches using the location of neural terminals, or the occupation of neuron volumes within the 3D brain space. Also, the presence of the neurons under a combination of spatial restrictions can be shown as well. NNG is a result of a multi-discipline collaboration between neuroscientists and computer scientists, and NNG has now been implemented on a coordinated brain space, that being, the Drosophila (fruit fly) brain.

6,2011,5742371,"CareCruiser: Exploring and visualizing plans, events, and effects interactively","In recent years, sophisticated visualization methods have been developed to support both, the logical structure and the time-oriented aspects of computer-executable clinical treatment plans. However, visualizing the effects of applying treatment plans as well as supporting the exploration of effects on the patient's condition are still largely unresolved tasks. To fill this gap, we have developed a prototype that enhances known visualization methods to communicate the processes of treatment plan application together with their effects on a patient's condition in an easily understandable way. Our prototype combines the advantages of enhanced visual recognition of patterns with traditional information of parameters' development. Thus, it provides means (1) to assess success or failure of previously applied treatment plans, (2) to explore the effects of each applied clinical action on the patient's condition, and (3) to identify sub-optimal treatment choices. These means help physicians to optimize their treatment choices and enable developers of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to investigate and readjust these treatment plans.",Theresia Gschwandtner;Wolfgang Aigner;Katharina Kaiser;Silvia Miksch;Andreas Seyfang,"Institute of Software Technology & Interactive Systems (ISIS), Vienna University of Technology, Austria;Institute of Software Technology & Interactive Systems (ISIS), Vienna University of Technology, Austria;Institute of Software Technology & Interactive Systems (ISIS), Vienna University of Technology, Austria;Institute of Software Technology & Interactive Systems (ISIS), Vienna University of Technology, Austria;Institute of Software Technology & Interactive Systems (ISIS), Vienna University of Technology, Austria",Data visualization;Image color analysis;Visualization;Diamond-like carbon;Color;Electronic mail;Prototypes,38,,11,7192670;7052497;6295805;6702502;7192713,AT;AT;AT;AT;AT,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,2011,5742372,Loose capacity-constrained representatives for the qualitative visual analysis in molecular dynamics,"Molecular dynamics is a widely used simulation technique to investigate material properties and structural changes under external forces. The availability of more powerful clusters and algorithms continues to increase the spatial and temporal extents of the simulation domain. This poses a particular challenge for the visualization of the underlying processes which might consist of millions of particles and thousands of time steps. Some application domains have developed special visual metaphors to only represent the relevant information of such data sets but these approaches typically require detailed domain knowledge that might not always be available or applicable. We propose a general technique that replaces the huge amount of simulated particles by a smaller set of representatives that are used for the visualization instead. The representatives capture the characteristics of the underlying particle density and exhibit coherency over time. We introduce loose capacity-constrained Voronoi diagrams for the generation of these representatives by means of a GPU-friendly, parallel algorithm. This way we achieve visualizations that reflect the particle distribution and geometric structure of the original data very faithfully. We evaluate our approach using real-world data sets from the application domains of material science, thermodynamics and dynamical systems theory.",Steffen Frey;Thomas Schl?mer;Sebastian Grottel;Carsten Dachsbacher;Oliver Deussen;Thomas Ertl,"Visualization Research Center Universit?t Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;Visualization Research Center Universit?t Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany;Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany;University of Konstanz, Germany;Visualization Research Center Universit?t Stuttgart (VISUS), Germany",Graphics processing unit;Data visualization;Measurement;Density functional theory;Visualization;Clustering algorithms;Parallel algorithms,8,4145230;4376143;5290736;4376195;4015464;5161005,2,6516425;7539644,DE;DE;DE;DE;DE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,2011,5742373,Interactive seismic interpretation with piecewise global energy minimization,"Increasing demands in world-wide energy consumption and oil depletion of large reservoirs have resulted in the need for exploring smaller and more complex oil reservoirs. Planning of the reservoir valorization usually starts with creating a model of the subsurface structures, including seismic faults and horizons. However, seismic interpretation and horizon tracing is a difficult and error-prone task, often resulting in hours of work needing to be manually repeated. In this paper, we propose a novel, interactive workflow for horizon interpretation based on well positions, which include additional geological and geophysical data captured by actual drillings. Instead of interpreting the volume slice-by-slice in 2D, we propose 3D seismic interpretation based on well positions. We introduce a combination of 2D and 3D minimal cost path and minimal cost surface tracing for extracting horizons with very little user input. By processing the volume based on well positions rather than slice-based, we are able to create a piecewise optimal horizon surface at interactive rates. We have integrated our system into a visual analysis platform which supports multiple linked views for fast verification, exploration and analysis of the extracted horizons.

We start from an existing approach for 2D uncertain vector field topology and extend this into 3D space. For this a number of conceptional and technical challenges in performance and visual representation arise. In order to solve them, we develop an acceleration for finding sink and source distributions. Having these distributions we use overlaps of their corresponding volumes to find separating structures and saddles. As part of the approach, we introduce uncertain saddle and boundary switch connectors and provide algorithms to extract them. For the visual representation, we use multiple direct volume renderings.

10,2011,5742375,Edge maps: Representing flow with bounded error,"Robust analysis of vector fields has been established as an important tool for deriving insights from the complex systems these fields model. Many analysis techniques rely on computing streamlines, a task often hampered by numerical instabilities. Approaches that ignore the resulting errors can lead to inconsistencies that may produce unreliable visualizations and ultimately prevent in-depth analysis. We propose a new representation for vector fields on surfaces that replaces numerical integration through triangles with linear maps defined on its boundary. This representation, called edge maps, is equivalent to computing all possible streamlines at a user defined error threshold. In spite of this error, all the streamlines computed using edge maps will be pairwise disjoint. Furthermore, our representation stores the error explicitly, and thus can be used to produce more informative visualizations. Given a piecewise-linear interpolated vector field, a recent result [15] shows that there are only 23 possible map classes for a triangle, permitting a concise description of flow behaviors. This work describes the details of computing edge maps, provides techniques to quantify and refine edge map error, and gives qualitative and visual comparisons to more traditional techniques.",Harsh Bhatia;Shreeraj Jadhav;Peer-Timo Bremer;Guoning Chen;Joshua A.

11,2011,5742376,View point evaluation and streamline filtering for flow visualization,"Visualization of flow fields with geometric primitives is often challenging due to occlusion that is inevitably introduced by 3D streamlines. In this paper, we present a novel view-dependent algorithm that can minimize occlusion and reveal important flow features for three dimensional flow fields. To analyze regions of higher importance, we utilize Shannon's entropy as a measure of vector complexity. An entropy field in the form of a three dimensional volume is extracted from the input vector field. To utilize this view-independent complexity measure for view-dependent calculations, we introduce the notion of a maximal entropy projection (MEP) framebuffer, which stores maximal entropy values as well as the corresponding depth values for a given viewpoint. With this information, we develop a view-dependent streamline selection algorithm that can evaluate and choose streamlines that will cause minimum occlusion to regions of higher importance. Based on a similar concept, we also propose a viewpoint selection algorithm that works hand-in-hand with our streamline selection algorithm to maximize the visibility of high complexity regions in the flow field.",Teng-Yok Lee;Oleg Mishchenko;Han-Wei Shen;Roger Crawfis,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA;Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, USA",Entropy;Streaming media;Complexity theory;Pixel;Tiles;Three dimensional displays;Tornadoes,37,1532833;5613460;4376173;1532833;5613460;4376173;398877;4015471;4376185;4135666;5613500;1532832;1532834;885690;4015449;5613461,10,7332955;6226391;6516552;6787133;7450407;7013203;7156349;6559983;6767149,US;US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Categorizing the set of many millions of particles, each of which is featured with a history of its movement positions and changing thermo-chemical states, helps understand the turbulence mechanism. We introduce a dual-space method to analyze such data, starting by clustering the time series curves in the phase space of the data, and then visualizing the corresponding trajectories of each cluster in the physical space. To cluster time series curves, we adopt a model-based clustering technique in a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, the characteristics of shape and relative position are particularly concerned in classifying the time series curves, and in the second stage, within each group of curves, clustering is further conducted based on how the curves change over time. In our work, we perform the model-based clustering in a semi-supervised manner. Users' domain knowledge is integrated through intuitive interaction tools to steer the clustering process. Our dual-space method has been used to analyze particle data in combustion simulations and can also be applied to other scientific simulations involving particle trajectory analysis work.",Jishang Wei;Hongfeng Yu;Ray W.

Solutions and techniques that investigate the important aspect of causal relationships among variables have not been sought. In this paper, we present a new approach to analyzing and visualizing time-varying multivariate volumetric and particle data sets through the study of information flow using the information-theoretic concept of transfer entropy. We employ time plot and circular graph to show information transfer for an overview of relations among all pairs of variables. To intuitively illustrate the influence relation between a pair of variables in the visualization, we modulate the color saturation and opacity for volumetric data sets and present three different visual representations, namely, ellipse, smoke, and metaball, for particle data sets.

While numerous guidelines exist to develop visualizations for individuals working on desktops, very little is known about how groups of individuals interpret and comprehend diverse types of visual constructs on larger displays. To study whether group size impacts the collective understanding of relationships in three-dimensional (3D) spatial structures when using different types of presentation, we carried out three experiments. We compared individual performance at structure understanding tasks to performance of groups containing two or four members. We consider two alternate visualization techniques for extracting 3D structure information: a 3D view with animated rotations and a combination of one static 3D plus three static two-dimensional (2D) projection views. In general our studies suggest that as group size increases, so does accuracy but with a cost in efficiency. Our results also suggest that beyond a threshold limit in group size, performance on certain tasks begins to degrade. Regardless of group size, participants performed better when the display was presented in the animation condition instead of the multiple static views, except when large groups needed to relate the visualization to a physical counterpart. We summarize our results in terms of Steiner's model for explaining the effects of group size and task characteristics on group performance.",Taylor Sando;Melanie Tory;Pourang Irani,"University of Manitoba, Canada;University of Victoria, Canada;University of Manitoba, Canada",Three dimensional displays;Animation;Visualization;Collaboration;Data visualization;Productivity;Accuracy,2,4384122;4384126;4384122;4384126;6789207;1028784;5290713;1250396;1541995,2,6035119;6634097,CA;CA;CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, support for these collaborative processes is limited and users often end up sharing either a single PC with one user taking control or using separate workstations, where support for tight collaboration is limited. In this paper, we present collaborative information linking which visually connects information across private and shared application windows to bridge knowledge gaps between users. We present the technical infrastructure for multi-user interaction and personalized meta-visualizations on large multi-projector displays, and demonstrate how personalized visual links connect information across existing applications modified in a minimally invasive manner.

The graphical interface provides an effective means for interactive exploration of search results using filter techniques, query expansion and navigation. Our observations indicate that, of three investigated retrieval tasks, the textual interface is sufficient for the phrase verification task, wherein both views support context-sensitive word choice, and the WORDGRAPH best supports the exploration of a phrase's context or the underlying corpus.

So far, density maps have mainly been used to visualize single attributes. Density maps are created in a two-way procedure; first smoothed trajectories are aggregated in a density field, and then the density field is visualized. In our approach, the user can explore attributes along trajectories by calculating a density field for multiple subsets of the data. These density fields are then either combined into a new density field or first visualized and then combined. Using a widget, called a distribution map, the user can interactively define subsets in an effective and intuitive way, and, supported by high-end graphics hardware the user gets fast feedback for these computationally expensive density field calculations. We show the versatility of our method with use cases in the maritime domain: to distinguish between periods in the temporal aggregation, to find anomalously behaving vessels, to solve ambiguities in density maps via drill down in the data, and for risk assessments.

In the spatial view of our system, traffic trajectories with various presentation styles are directly interactive with user brushing, together with convenient pattern exploration and selection through ring-style sliders. Improved ThemeRiver, embedded with glyphs indicating directional information, and multiple scatterplots with time as horizontal axes illustrate temporal information of the traffic flows.

23,2011,5742388,Dynamic network visualization in 1.5D,"The dynamic network visualization has been a challenging topic due to the complexity introduced by the extra time dimension. Existing solutions to this problem are usually good for the overview and presentation, but not for the interactive analysis. We propose in this paper a new approach which only considers the dynamic network central to a focus node (aka dynamic ego network). The navigation of the entire network is achieved by switching the focus node with user interactions. With this approach, the complexity of the compressed dynamic network is greatly reduced without sacrificing the network and time affinity central to the focus node. As a result, we are able to present each dynamic ego network in a single static view, well supporting user analysis on temporal network patterns. We describe our general framework including the network data pre-processing, 1.5D network and trend visualization design, layout algorithms, as well as several customized interactions. In addition, we show that our approach can also be extended to visualize the event-based and multimodal dynamic networks.

Node-link diagrams, commonly used to visualize graphs, suffer from visual clutter on large graphs. Edge bundling is an effective technique for alleviating clutter and revealing high-level edge patterns. Previous methods for general graph layouts either require a control mesh to guide the bundling process, which can introduce high variation in curvature along the bundles, or all-to-all force and compatibility calculations, which is not scalable. We propose a multilevel agglomerative edge bundling method based on a principled approach of minimizing ink needed to represent edges, with additional constraints on the curvature of the resulting splines. The proposed method is much faster than previous ones, able to bundle hundreds of thousands of edges in seconds, and one million edges in a few minutes.",Emden R.

To be effective and appealing for mainstream application, navigation should use paradigms and metaphors that users are already familiar with. One such intuitive navigation paradigm is interactive route planning on a connected network. We have employed such an interface and have paired it with a prominent high-dimensional visualization paradigm showing the N-D data in undistorted raw form: parallel coordinates. In our network interface, the dimensions form nodes that are connected by a network of edges representing the strength of association between dimensions. A user then interactively specifies nodes/edges to visit, and the system computes an optimal route, which can be further edited and manipulated. In our interface, this route is captured by a parallel coordinate data display in which the dimension ordering is configured by the specified route. Our framework serves both as a data exploration environment and as an interactive presentation platform to demonstrate, explain, and justify any identified relationships to others.

7,2012,6183573,Analyzing the evolution of large scale structures in the universe with velocity based methods,"The formation of cosmic structure results from the action of gravity on matter in an expanding Universe. As the evolution proceeds, the velocity field changes from being single-valued almost everywhere in space to being multi-valued over a complex web of `multistreaming' regions associated with the formation of large-scale structure (LSS) such as halos (or clumps), filaments, and sheets. Until recently, these structures have been investigated primarily via the (scalar) mass density field. In this application paper we apply data analysis and visualization techniques to cosmological simulations with the aim of studying multistreaming regions using velocity-based probes. Compared to the current practice of using density information (e.g., morphology estimators, locating overdense regions with halo finders), we show that velocity-based methods can provide useful supporting, as well as complementary, information. Because the density field and multistreaming are correlated but do not contain the same information, new and interesting information about the properties of the large-scale structure may be extracted, e.g., capturing dynamical behavior not possible with density-based estimators. Incorporating a novel method for setting thresholds for the velocity-based estimators, we study the relationships between the density field as represented by compact overdense halos and the different properties of multistreaming regions as represented by different velocity-based estimators.",Uliana Popov;Eddy Chandra;Katrin Heitmann;Salman Habib;James Ahrens;Alex Pang,;;;;;,Data visualisation;Astronomy computing;Cosmology;Data analysis,22,5290736;4376197,1,7465250,;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a novel system for analyzing temporal changes in the activities and interests of bloggers through a 3D visualization of phrase dependency structures in sentences. We first extract events that represent bloggers' activities and interests through analyzing the phrase dependencies of sentences in a blog archive. We roughly categorize the retrieved events according to the thematic roles (such as the experiencer, agent, and location) of the noun within the events, and then store them in a dependency database so that we can retrieve events that involve a given topic. Second, we present a 3D visualization framework for exploring temporal changes in events related to a topic. Our framework enables users to find events about a topic that appear within a specific timing, and drill down details of the events. It also enables users to compare events with different timings and/or on multiple topics. Moreover, it allows them to observe an overview of temporal changes in sets of events, and long-term changes in the frequency of events to assist users in finding trends.

In addition, many edge bundling algorithms are computationally complex to prevent them from scaling up for extremely large graphs.

10,2012,6183576,A maxent-stress model for graph layout,"In some applications of graph visualization, input edges have associated target lengths. Dealing with these lengths is a challenge, especially for large graphs. Stress models are often employed in this situation. However, the traditional full stress model is not scalable due to its reliance on an initial all-pairs shortest path calculation. A number of fast approximation algorithms have been proposed. While they work well for some graphs, the results are less satisfactory on graphs of intrinsically high dimension, because nodes overlap unnecessarily. We propose a solution, called the maxent-stress model, which applies the principle of maximum entropy to cope with the extra degrees of freedom. We describe a force-augmented stress majorization algorithm that solves the maxent-stress model. Numerical results show that the algorithm scales well, and provides acceptable layouts for large, non-rigid graphs.

12,2012,6183578,The mental map and memorability in dynamic graphs,"In dynamic graph drawing, preserving the mental map, or ensuring that the location of nodes do not change significantly as the information evolves over time is considered an important property by algorithm designers. Many prior experiments have attempted to verify this principle, with surprisingly little success. These experiments have used several different algorithmic methods, a variety of graph interpretation questions on both real and fabricated data, and different presentation methods. However, none of the results have conclusively demonstrated the importance of mental map preservation on task performance. Our experiment measures the efficacy of the dynamic graph drawing in a different manner: we look at how memorable the evolving graph is, rather than how easy it is to interpret. As observed in the previous studies, we found no significant difference in terms of response time or error rate when preserving the mental map. While preserving the mental map is a good idea in principle, we find that it may not always support performance. However, our qualitative data suggests that, in terms of the user's perception, preserving the mental map makes memorability tasks easier. Our qualitative data also suggests that there may be two features of the dynamic graph drawing that may assist in their memorability: interesting subgraphs that remain visible over time and interesting patterns in node movement. The former is supported by preserving the mental map while the latter is not.",Daniel Archambault;Helen C.

This study used a tensor field sampled from a full-brain diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) dataset. The independent variables include illumination model (global illumination and OpenGL-style local illumination), texture (with and without), motion (with and without), and task. The three spatial analysis tasks are: (1) a depth-judgment task: determining which of two marked tubes is closer to the user's viewpoint, (2) a visual-tracing task: marking the endpoint of a tube, and (3) a contact-judgment task: analyzing tube-sphere penetration. Our results indicate that global illumination did not improve task completion time for the tasks we measured. Global illumination reduced the errors in participants' answers over local OpenGLstyle rendering for the visual-tracing task only when motion was present. Motion contributed to spatial understanding for all tasks, but at the cost of longer task completion time. A high-frequency texture pattern led to longer task completion times and higher error rates.

However, current analysis methods demand too much time and expert knowledge in order to apply 4D MRI in the clinics or larger clinical studies. One missing piece are methods allowing to gain a quick overview of the flow data's main properties. We present a line predicate approach that sorts precalculated integral lines, which capture the complete flow dynamics, into bundles with similar properties. We introduce several streamline and pathline predicates that allow to structure the flow according to various features useful for blood flow analysis, such as, e.g., velocity distribution, vortices, and flow paths. The user can combine these predicates flexibly and by that create flow structures that help to gain overview and carve out special features of the current dataset.

The choice of suitable attributes, describing the path lines, is, however, still an open question. This paper addresses this question performing a statistical analysis of the path line attribute space. In this way we are able to balance the usage of computing power and storage with the necessity to not loose relevant information.

16,2012,6183582,A benchmark for evaluating FTLE computations,"The Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) has become a widespread tool for analyzing unsteady flow behavior. For its computation, several numerical methods have been introduced, which provide trade-offs between performance and accuracy. In order to decide which methods and parameter settings are suitable for a particular application, an evaluation of the different FTLE methods is necessary. We propose a general benchmark for FTLE computation, which consists of a number of 2D time-dependent flow fields and error measures. Evaluating the accuracy of a numerically computed FTLE field requires a ground truth, which is not available for realistic flow data sets, since such fields can generally not be described in a closed form. To overcome this, we introduce approaches to create non-trivial vector fields with a closed-form formulation of the FTLE field. Using this, we introduce a set of benchmark flow data sets that resemble relevant geometric aspects of Lagrangian structures, but have an analytic solution for FTLE. Based on this ground truth, we perform a comparative evaluation of three standard FTLE concepts. We suggest error measures based on the variance of both, the fields and the extracted ridge structures.",Alexander Kuhn;Christian R?ssl;Tino Weinkauf;Holger Theisel,;;;,Vectors;Approximation methods;Measurement uncertainty;Benchmark testing;Accuracy;Jacobian matrices;Timing,26,4376175;5611509;4475467;4376174,14,7192689;7422124;6320574;7539598,;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because very few works synthesize the benefits of these approaches into one framework, we propose a hybrid technique. In this work, we present a novel method of dense flow visualization that produces high contrast images (typical of streamline approaches), with manageable spatial frequency. We begin by introducing a notion of a streamline thickness function and thickness wave sources, and then compute the resulting image as a coherent wave interference pattern. We show that this problem is equivalent to finding the dominant eigenvector of a sparse matrix and employ the power iterations numerical scheme to demonstrate an efficient parallel implementation.

18,2012,6183584,Output-coherent image-space LIC for surface flow visualization,"Image-space line integral convolution (LIC) is a popular approach for visualizing surface vector fields due to its simplicity and high efficiency. To avoid inconsistencies or color blur during the user interactions in the image-space approach, some methods use surface parameterization or 3D volume texture for the effect of smooth transition, which often require expensive computational or memory cost. Furthermore, those methods cannot achieve consistent LIC results in both granularity and color distribution on different scales. This paper introduces a novel image-space LIC for surface flows that preserves the texture coherence during user interactions. To make the noise textures under different viewpoints coherent, we propose a simple texture mapping technique that is local, robust and effective. Meanwhile, our approach pre-computes a sequence of mipmap noise textures in a coarse-to-fine manner, leading to consistent transition when the model is zoomed. Prior to perform LIC in the image space, the mipmap noise textures are mapped onto each triangle with randomly assigned texture coordinates. Then, a standard image-space LIC based on the projected vector fields is performed to generate the flow texture. The proposed approach is simple and very suitable for GPU acceleration.

19,2012,6183585,A flow-guided file layout for out-of-core streamline computation,"We present a file layout algorithm for flow fields to improve runtime I/O efficiency for out-of-core streamline computation. Because of the increasing discrepancy between the speed of processors and storage devices, the cost of I/O becomes a major bottleneck for out-of-core computation. To reduce the I/O cost, loading data with better spatial locality has proved to be effective. It is also known that sequential file access is more efficient. To facilitate efficient streamline computation, we propose to reorganize the data blocks in a file following the data access pattern so that more efficient I/O and effective prefetching can be accomplished. To achieve the goal, we divide the domain into small spatial blocks and order the blocks into a linear layout based on the underlying flow directions. The ordering is done using a weighted directed graph model which can be formulated as a linear graph arrangement problem. Our goal is to arrange the file in a way consistent with the data access pattern during streamline computation. This allows us to prefetch a contiguous segment of data at a time from disk and minimize the memory cache miss rate. We use a recursive partitioning method to approximate the optimal layout. Our experimental results show that the resulting file layout reduces I/O cost and hence enables more efficient out-of-core streamline computation.",Chun-Ming Chen;L. Xu;T. Lee;H.

Since, in general, a perfectly perpendicular surface to a vector field does not exist, we propose and minimize an error metric to enforce perpendicularity as much as possible. Our algorithm constructs an APAP surface by deforming a seed surface anchored in a domain point. In the discrete setting this minimization results in iteratively solving linear least-squares problems and integrating a locally scaled version of the vector field. The definition of the error metric and its numerical minimization guarantee that the minimum zero is attained for the perfectly perpendicular surface if it exists. Otherwise, the minimization converges to the same local minimum independent of the seed configuration, and the resulting surface is - in a least-squares sense - as perpendicular as possible to the flow.

However, the 1D peak finding technique does not extend to higherdimensional classification. In this work, we develop a new method for peak finding with multidimensional transfer functions, which looks for peaks along the image of the ray. We use piecewise approximations to dynamically sample in transfer function space between world-space samples. As with unidimensional peak finding, this approach is useful for specifying transfer functions with greater precision, and for accurately rendering noisy volume data at lower sampling rates. Multidimensional peak finding produces comparable image quality with order-of-magnitude better performance, and can reproduce features omitted entirely by standard classification.

One important illustrative technique for such visualizations are cutaways. Currently cutaways are placed manually or using view-vector based approaches. We propose to optimize the visibility of important target features based on a degree-of-interest (DOI) function. The DOI is specified during interactive visual analysis, e.g., by brushing scatterplots. We show that the problem of placing cutaway boxes optimally is NP-hard in the number of boxes. To overcome this obstacle, we present an intelligent method to compute cutaways. Geometric cutaway objects are positioned using a view-dependent objective function which optimizes the visibility of all features. In order to approximate the optimal solution, we use a Monte Carlo method and exploit temporal coherence in dynamic scenes. Performance-critical parts are implemented on the GPU.

We develop a technique that facilitates visualization and analysis of such complex material interface behavior over time. For this matter, we track a surface parametrization of time-varying material interfaces and identify locations of interaction between material interfaces and fluid particles.

In contrast, CPR offers the possibility to visualize the vessel lumen by cutting a single vessel along its centerline. Extending the idea of CPR, we propose a novel technique, called Centerline Reformation (CR), which is capable of visualizing the lumen of spatially arbitrarily oriented vessels not necessarily connected in a tree structure. In order to visually emphasize depth, overlap and occlusion, halos can optionally envelope the vessel lumen. The required vessel centerlines are obtained from volumetric data by performing a scale-space based feature extraction.

Given a political map and values associated with each country in the map, a cartogram is a distorted map in which the areas of the countries are proportional to the corresponding values. In the circular-arc cartogram model straight-line segments can be replaced by circular arcs in order to modify the areas of the polygons, while the corners of the polygons remain fixed. The countries in circular-arc cartograms have the aesthetically pleasing appearance of clouds or snowflakes, depending on whether their edges are bent outwards or inwards. This makes it easy to determine whether a country has grown or shrunk, just by its overall shape. We show that determining whether a given map and given area-values can be realized as a circular-arc cartogram is an NP-hard problem. Next we describe a heuristic method for constructing circular-arc cartograms, which uses a max-flow computation on the dual graph of the map, along with a computation of the straight skeleton of the underlying polygonal decomposition.

3,2013,6596123,Constrained optimization for disoccluding geographic landmarks in 3D urban maps,"In composing hand-drawn 3D urban maps, the most common design problem is to avoid overlaps between geographic features such as roads and buildings by displacing them consistently over the map domain. Nonetheless, automating this map design process is still a challenging task because we have to maximally retain the 3D depth perception inherent in pairs of parallel lines embedded in the original layout of such geographic features. This paper presents a novel approach to disoccluding important geographic features when creating 3D urban maps for enhancing their visual readability. This is accomplished by formulating the design criteria as a constrained optimization problem based on the linear programming approach. Our mathematical formulation allows us to systematically eliminate occlusions of landmark roads and buildings, and further controls the degree of local 3D map deformation by devising an objective function to be minimized.

We present a technique that extends the Massive Sequence View (MSV) for the analysis of the temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks. Using features in the data as well as in the visualization based on the Gestalt principles closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the MSV to make these features stand out. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars.

With a growing volume of data represented as graphs, the problem of understanding and analyzing the variations in a collection of graphs is of increasing importance. We present an algorithm to compute a single summary graph that efficiently encodes an entire collection of graphs by finding and merging similar nodes and edges. Instead of only merging nodes and edges that are exactly the same, we use domain-specific comparison functions to collapse similar nodes and edges which allows us to generate more compact representations of the collection. In addition, we have developed methods that allow users to interactively control the display of these summary graphs. These interactions include the ability to highlight individual graphs in the summary, control the succinctness of the summary, and explicitly define when specific nodes should or should not be merged. We show that our approach to generating and interacting with graph summaries leads to a better understanding of a graph collection by allowing users to more easily identify common substructures and key differences between graphs.",David Koop;Juliana Freire;Cludio T.

We propose a transfer function (TF) design approach based on user selected samples in the spatial domain to make multivariate volumetric data visualization more accessible for domain users. Specifically, the user starts the visualization by probing features of interest on slices and the data values are instantly queried by user selection. The queried sample values are then used to automatically and robustly generate high dimensional transfer functions (HDTFs) via kernel density estimation (KDE). Alternatively, 2D Gaussian TFs can be automatically generated in the dimensionality reduced space using these samples. With the extracted features rendered in the volume rendering view, the user can further refine these features using segmentation brushes.

Accuracy and response time are used as the metrics to evaluate the usefulness of Depth of Field. The onsite user study has two parts: static and dynamic. Eye tracking is used to monitor the gaze of the subjects. From our results we see that though Depth of Field does not act as a proper depth cue in all conditions, it can be used to reinforce the perception of which feature is in front of the other.

12,2013,6596132,Transformations for volumetric range distribution queries,"Volumetric datasets continue to grow in size, and there is continued demand for interactive analysis on these datasets. Because storage device throughputs are not increasing as quickly, interactive analysis workflows are becoming working set-constrained. In an ideal workflow, the working set complexity of the interactive analysis portion of the workflow should depend primarily on the size of the analysis result being produced, rather than on the size of the data being analyzed. Past works in online analytical processing and visualization have addressed this problem within application-specific contexts, but have not generalized their solutions to a wider variety of visualization applications. We propose a general framework for reducing the working set complexity of the interactive portion of visualization workflows that can be built on top of distribution range queries, as well as a technique within this framework able to support multiple visualization applications. Transformations are applied in the preprocessing phase of the workflow to enable fast, approximate volumetric distribution range queries with low working set complexity. Interactive application algorithms are then adapted to make use of these distribution range queries, enabling efficient interactive workflows on large-scale data.

During the intervention the surgeon places electrodes inside of the patient's brain to stimulate specific regions. Since these regions span only a couple of millimeters, and electrode misplacement has severe consequences, reliable and accurate navigation is of great importance. Usually the surgeon relies on fused CT and MRI data sets, as well as direct feedback from the patient. More recently Microelectrode Recordings (MER), which support navigation by measuring the electric field of the patient's brain, are also used. We propose a visualization system that fuses the different modalities: imaging data, MER and patient checks, as well as the related uncertainties, in an intuitive way to present placement-related information in a consistent view with the goal of supporting the surgeon in the final placement of the stimulating electrode.

In this data acquisition modality, the electric fields generated by neurons are measured at the scalp. Although this technology is capable of measuring activity from a group of neurons, recent efforts provide evidence that these small neuronal collections communicate with other, distant assemblies in the brain's cortex. These collaborative neural assemblies are often found by examining the EEG record to find shared activity patterns. In this paper, we present a system that focuses on extracting and visualizing potential neural activity patterns directly from EEG data. Using our system, neuroscientists may investigate the spectral dynamics of signals generated by individual electrodes or groups of sensors. Additionally, users may interactively generate queries which are processed to reveal which areas of the brain may exhibit common activation patterns across time and frequency.

The wind tunnel requires an accompanying visual analysis tool with which we can effectively peer into the relationships between the actual and simulated flow fields. In this paper, we attempt to exploit an augmented reality display to that end. The basic idea is to superimpose the computationally-visualized MI simulated pressure field onto the actual flow velocity structure physically-visualized with oil misttraced streaklines instantaneously. Spatial registration of these two visual sources is rather straight-forward since the fixed cylinder of the wind tunnel is easily identified, whereas visualizing the MI simulated pressure field can be characterized with a sophisticated scheme based on differential topology. Considering the fact that vortex centers are located at local minima in the pressure field, and each minimum is surrounded by a derived topological feature called ridge cycle, we can colorize the field adaptively and keep track of Karman vortex streets robustly, regardless of drastic change in the Reynolds number of the flow field.",Yuriko Takeshima;Issei Fujishiro;Shigeo Takahashi;Toshiyuki Hayase,"Tohoku University, Japan;Keio University, Japan;The University of Tokyo, Japan;Tohoku University, Japan",Visualization;Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Numerical models;Topology;Solid modeling;Current measurement,27,963459;663875;963459;663875;865879;35197;4767549;5753890;1541996;5290728;1500535,0,,JP;JP;JP;JP,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By interpreting PLIC reconstruction as an isosurface extraction problem from the first-order Taylor approximation of the underlying volume of fluid field, we obtain a framework for error analysis and geometric representation of the reconstruction including the fluxes involved in the simulation.

17,2013,6596137,Illustrative visualization of cardiac and aortic blood flow from 4D MRI data,"In the last years, illustrative methods have found their way into flow visualization since they communicate difficult information in a comprehensible way. This is of great benefit especially in domains where the audience does not necessarily have flow expertise. One such domain is the medical field where the development of 4D MR imaging (for in-vivo 3D blood flow measurement) lead to an increased demand for easy flow analysis techniques. The goal and the challenge is to transfer the data into simple visualizations supporting the physician with flow interpretation and decision making. In this work, we take one step towards this goal. We present an approach for the illustrative visualization of steady flow features occurring in 4D MRI data of heart and aorta. Like shown in manually created illustrations, we restrict our visualization to the main data characteristics and do not depict every flow detail. The input for our method are flow features extracted from a dataset's complete set of streamlines with the help of line predicates. We create an abstract depiction of these line bundles by selecting a set of bundle representatives reflecting the most important flow aspects. These lines are rendered as three-dimensional arrows that are fused in areas where they represent the same flow. Since vortices are another important flow information for a physician, we identify these regions in the 4D MRI data and display them as unobtrusive, tube-like structures. A hatching texture provides for a visual effect of rotational blood flow. By applying our illustration technique to diverse flow structures of several 4D MRI datasets, we demonstrate that the abstract visualization is useful to gain an easier insight into the data. Feedback of medical experts confirmed the usefulness and revealed limitations of our work. The images are restricted to the essential flow features and, therefore, clearer and less cluttered.

However, the ability to perform cost-effective data querying and indexing is often not incorporated, which posts a serious limitation as the size of time-varying data continue to grow. In this paper, we present a new approach that unifies data compacting, indexing and classification into a single framework. We achieve this by transforming the time-activity curve representation of a time-varying data set into a hierarchical symbolic representation. We further build an indexable version of the data hierarchy, from which we create the iTree for visual representation of the time-varying data.

To address this problem, we propose three general, spatiotemporal metrics to quantify the significant properties of data features-concentration, continuity and co-occurrence, named collectively as CO3. We implemented an interactive visualization system to investigate complex multivariate time-varying data from satellite remote sensing with great spatial resolutions, as well as from real-time continental-scale power grid monitoring with great temporal resolutions. The system integrates CO3 metrics with an elegant multi-space user interaction tool to provide various forms of quantitative user feedback. Through these, the system supports an iterative user-driven analysis process.

For detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal structures and patterns in the eye tracking data, we employ visual analytics techniques adopted from related methodology for geographic movement data by Andrienko et al. In this way, we complement the statistical analysis of task completion times and error rates reported by Burch et al. with spatio-temporal strategies that explain the variation in completion times. We identify differences between task solution strategies dependent on layout type, orientation, and task difficulty. Furthermore, we examine differences between groups of participants split according to completion time. Our analysis identifies that for all layouts it took nearly the same time to find the task solution node, but in the radial layout the solution was not confirmed directly. Instead, a more frequent cross-checking occurs afterwards, which is the main reason for the impaired performance of radial layouts.",Michael Burch;Gennady Andrienko;Natalia Andrienko;Markus Hferlin;Michael Raschke;Daniel Weiskopf,"VISUS - Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany;Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany;Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany;VISUS - Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany;VISUS - Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany;VISUS - Visualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart, Germany",Layout;Trajectory;Data visualization;Visual analytics;Tracking;Color,31,5653580;6327295;5432167;5653580;6327295;5432167;6065011;4126225;4906848;877520;6056510;1260759;5613432,7,7314288;7851164;7208761;7272587,DE;DE;DE;DE;DE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,2013,6596143,Exploring agent-based simulations in political science using Aggregate Temporal Graphs,"Agent-based simulation has become a key technique for modeling and simulating dynamic, complicated behaviors in social and behavioral sciences. As these simulations become more complex, they generate an increasingly large amount of data. Lacking the appropriate tools and support, it has become difficult for social scientists to interpret and analyze the results of these simulations. In this paper, we introduce the Aggregate Temporal Graph (ATG), a graph formulation that can be used to capture complex relationships between discrete simulation states in time. Using this formulation, we can assist social scientists in identifying critical simulation states by examining graph substructures. In particular, we define the concept of a Gateway and its inverse, a Terminal, which capture the relationships between pivotal states in the simulation and their inevitable outcomes. We propose two real-time computable algorithms to identify these relationships and provide a proof of correctness, complexity analysis, and empirical run-time analysis. We demonstrate the use of these algorithms on a large-scale social science simulation of political power and violence in present-day Thailand, and discuss broader applications of the ATG and associated algorithms in other domains such as analytic provenance.",R.

Our system enables the interactive planning of both the placement and operation of off-shore structures. We illustrate this using a real-world simulation of the Gulf of Mexico. Off-shore structures, such as those used for oil exploration, are vulnerable to hazards caused by strong loop currents. The oil and gas industry therefore relies on accurate ocean forecasting systems for planning their operations. Nowadays, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations resulting in multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued data, so-called ensemble data. Changes in sea surface elevation are a good indicator for the movement of loop current eddies, and our visualization approach enables their interactive exploration and analysis. We enable analysis of the spatial domain, for planning the placement of structures, as well as detailed exploration of the temporal evolution at any chosen position, for the prediction of critical ocean states that require the shutdown of rig operations.",Thomas Hllt;Ahmed Magdy;Guoning Chen;Ganesh Gopalakrishnan;Ibrahim Hoteit;Charles D.

Shape alterations are often the result of flexibility changes in a set of localized neighborhoods that may or may not act in concert. Computational models have been developed to predict flexibility changes under varying empirical parameters. In this paper, we tackle a significant challenge facing scientists when analyzing outputs of a computational model, namely how to identify, examine, compare, and group interesting neighborhoods of proteins under different parameter sets. This is a difficult task since comparisons over protein subunits that comprise diverse neighborhoods are often too complex to characterize with a simple metric and too numerous to analyze manually.

In contrast, vertex-vertex relations are illustrated distinguishably from edge-edge relations using straight links as representations. While the shape of links is used to differentiate between the relation types, the weights of the edge-edge relations are mapped to the width and color of the curves.

In this paper, we introduce the FlowGraph, a novel compound graph representation that organizes streamline clusters and spatial regions hierarchically for occlusion-free and controllable visual exploration. Our approach works with any seeding strategies as long as the domain is well covered and important flow features are captured. By transforming a flow field to a graph representation, we enable observation and exploration of the relationships among streamline clusters, spatial regions and their interconnection in the transformed space. The FlowGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts streamline clusters and spatial regions in various levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides flow field exploration and understanding. Through brushing and linking in conjunction with the spatial streamline view, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowGraph with several visual exploration and comparison tasks that can not be well accomplished using the streamline view alone.

We propose a region-growing algorithm that extracts the linear neighborhood for a certain position. The region is characterized by linear flow behavior up to a user-defined approximation threshold. While this first method computes the size of a region given the mentioned threshold, our second method computes the quality of a linear approximation given a user-defined n-ring neighborhood. The scalar field resulting from the second method is, therefore, called affine linear approximation error. Isosurfaces of this field show regions of close-to-linear and non-linear flow behavior.

Streamline queries allow us to rapidly identify streamlines that share similar geometric features to the target streamline. Streamline clustering allows us to group together streamlines of similar shapes.

The derivate is an asymmetric tensor field, which allows the deduction of scalar quantities reflecting distinctive field properties like strength of rotation or shear. The basis of the background visualization is a vector and scalar clustering approach. The local features are defined as the extrema of the respective scalar fields.

We use two basic operations to iteratively replace consecutive arcs until the desired complexity is reached. Our results are not restricted to arcs ending at input vertices. The method can be steered towards different degrees of 'curviness': we can encourage or discourage the use of arcs with a large central angle via a single parameter. Our method creates visually pleasing results even for very low output complexities. We conducted an online user study investigating the effectiveness of the curved schematizations compared to straight-line schematizations of equivalent complexity. While the visual complexity of the curved shapes was judged higher than those using straight lines, users generally preferred curved schematizations.

In this paper, we introduce FlowString, a novel approach that extracts shape invariant features from streamlines and utilizes a string-based method for exploratory streamline analysis and visualization. Our solution first resamples streamlines by considering their local feature scales. We then classify resampled points along streamlines based on the shape similarity around their local neighborhoods. We encode each streamline into a string of well-selected shape characters, from which we construct meaningful words for querying and retrieval. A unique feature of our approach is that it captures intrinsic streamline similarity that is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling. Leveraging the suffix tree, we enable efficient search of streamline patterns with arbitrary lengths with the complexity linear to the size of the respective pattern. We design an intuitive interface and user interactions to support flexible querying, allowing exact and approximate searches for robust partial streamline similarity matching. Users can perform queries at either the character level or the word level, and define their own characters or words conveniently for customized search.

We propose a method to solve this problem by partitioning the set of all objects into subsets that are each visualized using an aggregated multivariate glyph that shows the distribution of several attributes of its objects, such as heading, type and velocity. We choose the combination of subsets and glyph design such that the glyphs do not overlap and the number of subsets is approximately maximal. The partition is maintained and updated while the objects move. We use examples from the maritime domain, but our method is applicable to a wider range of dynamic data. Through a user study we find that, for a set of representative tasks, our method does not perform significantly worse than competitive visualizations with respect to correctness.

One way to approach this question is to identify structures of interest by a human observer. The challenge then, is to find similar structures in the same or other datasets on different scales and orientations. In this paper, we propose to use moment invariants as pattern descriptors for flow fields. Moment invariants are one of the most popular techniques for the description of objects in the field of image recognition. They have recently also been applied to identify 2D vector patterns limited to the directional properties of flow fields. In contrast to previous work, we follow the intuitive approach of moment normalization, which results in a complete and independent set of translation, rotation, and scaling invariant flow field descriptors. They also allow to distinguish flow features with different velocity profiles.

Most existing simplification techniques based on the topological skeleton successively remove pairs of critical points connected by separatrices, using distance or area-based relevance measures. These methods rely on the stable extraction of the topological skeleton, which can be difficult due to instability in numerical integration, especially when processing highly rotational flows. These geometric metrics do not consider the flow magnitude, an important physical property of the flow. In this paper, we propose a novel simplification scheme derived from the recently introduced topological notion of robustness, which provides a complementary view on flow structure compared to the traditional topological-skeleton-based approaches. Robustness enables the pruning of sets of critical points according to a quantitative measure of their stability, that is, the minimum amount of vector field perturbation required to remove them. This leads to a hierarchical simplification scheme that encodes flow magnitude in its perturbation metric. Our novel simplification algorithm is based on degree theory, has fewer boundary restrictions, and so can handle more general cases. Finally, we provide an implementation under the piecewise-linear setting and apply it to both synthetic and real-world datasets.",Primoz Skraba; Bei Wang; Guoning Chen;Paul Rosen,"Jozef Stefan Institute, Slovenia;Sci.

Its main challenges for large data sets are visual clutter and over plotting which hamper the recognition of patterns in the data. We present an edge-bundling method using density-based clustering for each dimension. This reduces clutter and provides a faster overview of clusters and trends. Moreover, it allows rendering the clustered lines using polygons, decreasing rendering time remarkably. In addition, we design interactions to support multidimensional clustering with this method.

9,2014,6787138,Visual Signature of High-Dimensional Geometry in Parallel Coordinates,"Although we can interactively rotate a 3D projected high-dimensional geometry and observe its dynamic changes, this traditional visualization method is limited and highly sensitive to the choice of viewing direction. Parallel-coordinates plots supplement this visualization scenario by providing statistical analysis of the geometry for distinct pairs of co-dimensions. Such analysis results in visual signatures that embed geometric structures such as symmetry, and thus allows us to overview the status of the missing dimensions while exploring the projected geometry. This paper presents a blue-noise sampling approach for efficient construction of continuous parallel-coordinates plots of high-dimensional geometric surfaces defined by mathematical equations. We employ the parallel-coordinates plots with the embedded visual signatures to assist the interactive exploration of high-dimensional geometries, typically for 2-manifold embedded in 4-space. While we interactively explore the 3D projected geometry, we can observe dynamic changes on its visual signature. Various geometric properties can also be identified and visualized. Moreover, we can interactively brush the plots, and see their counterparts in the 3D projection. Assorted geometric properties such as curvature can further be used to enhance the visual signature.",Xiaoqi Yan;Chi Fu Lai;Chi Wing Fu,"Nanyang Technol. Univ., Singapore, Singapore;Nanyang Technol.

Given a set of v variables, there are v(v- 1)/2 pairs of variables, and thus the same number of possible pair wise scatter plots. Therefore for even small sets of variables, the number of scatter plots can be large. Scatter plot matrices (SPLOMs) can easily run out of pixels when presenting high-dimensional data. We introduce a theoretical method and a testbed for assessing whether our method can be used to guide interactive exploration of high-dimensional data. The method is based on nine characterizations of the 2D distributions of orthogonal pair wise projections on a set of points in multidimensional Euclidean space. Working directly with these characterizations, we can locate anomalies for further analysis or search for similar distributions in a large SPLOM with more than a hundred dimensions.

Existing network visualizations have allowed nodes to be aggregated based on node attributes or network topology, each of which has its own advantages. However, very few previous systems have the capability to enjoy the best of both worlds. This paper presents OnionGraph, an integrated framework for exploratory visual analysis of large heterogeneous networks. OnionGraph allows nodes to be aggregated based on either node attributes, topology, or a mixture of both. Subsets of nodes can be flexibly split and merged under the hierarchical focus+context interaction model, supporting sophisticated analysis of the network data. Node aggregations that contain subsets of nodes are displayed with multiple concentric circles, or the onion metaphor, indicating how many levels of abstraction they contain.

13,2014,6787142,Rebuilding KEGG Maps: Algorithms and Benefits,"Static drawings of biological pathways are still an important research tool for biologists. Gerhard Michal created his seminal drawings of metabolic networks in the 1960s and thus defined canonical representations of some key pathways. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) provides the most popular static drawings of biological networks of different types, used in a huge number of publications. These drawings are so widely known that they are immediately recognizable to most biologists. This enables collaborative work and simplifies the communication of analysis results. Automatic layout of these pathway maps is complicated by the fact that the information available from KEGG does not contain the entire layout information of the reference maps. Here we present a fully automated algorithm for interactive KEGG layout construction. The algorithm conserves the original KEGG layout to the extent possible while improving readability by removing unnecessary elements (in organism-specific maps). Multiple pathway maps can be laid out simultaneously to facilitate the navigation of larger networks. The algorithm supports the hierarchical layout of sub networks and thus supports interactive exploration of large datasets.",Andreas Gerasch;Michael Kaufmann;Oliver Kohlbacher,"Dept. of Comput.

14,2014,6787143,Improved Optimal and Approximate Power Graph Compression for Clearer Visualisation of Dense Graphs,"Drawings of highly connected (dense) graphs can be very difficult to read. Power Graph Analysis offers an alternate way to draw a graph in which sets of nodes with common neighbours are shown grouped into modules. An edge connected to the module then implies a connection to each member of the module. Thus, the entire graph may be represented with much less clutter and without loss of detail. A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of dense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power graphs is difficult. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal power-graph with only one module is NP-hard and therefore likely NP-hard in the general case. We give an ILP model for power graph computation and discuss why ILP and CP techniques are poorly suited to the problem. Instead, we are able to find optimal solutions much more quickly using a custom search method. We also show how to restrict this type of search to allow only limited back-tracking to provide a heuristic that has better speed and better results than previously known heuristics.",Tim Dwyer;Christopher Mears;Kerri Morgan;Todd Niven;Kim Marriott;Mark Wallace,"Monash Univ., Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Monash Univ., Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Monash Univ., Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Monash Univ., Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Monash Univ., Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Monash Univ., Melbourne, VIC, Australia",Programming;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Clutter;Search methods;Image edge detection;Biology,17,6634098;6634098;5742390;6596147,7,7192733;7536109;7539373,AU;AU;AU;AU;AU;AU,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,2014,6787157,Maps of Computer Science,"We describe a practical approach for visual exploration of research papers. Specifically, we use the titles of papers from the DBLP database to create what we call maps of computer science (MoCS).

With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the base map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or groups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to change the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap overlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research group profiles can be visualized using heatmap overlays over a specific journal or conference base map. We outline a modular and extensible system for term extraction using natural language processing techniques, and show the applicability of methods of information retrieval to calculation of term similarity and creation of a topic map.

However there have been few visual analytics approaches that have been proposed to help analysts study graph evolutions in the context of graph metrics. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called GraphFlow, to visualize dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous approaches that provide users with an animated visualization, GraphFlow offers a static flow visualization that summarizes the graph metrics of the entire graph and its evolution over time. Our solution supports the discovery of high-level patterns that are difficult to identify in an animation or in individual static representations. In addition, GraphFlow provides users with a set of interactions to create filtered views. These views allow users to investigate why a particular pattern has occurred. We showcase the versatility of GraphFlow using two different datasets and describe how it can help users gain insights into complex dynamic graphs.",Weiwei Cui; Xiting Wang; Shixia Liu;Nathalie H.

18,2014,6787160,Visualizing Hidden Themes of Taxi Movement with Semantic Transformation,"A new methodology is developed to discover and analyze the hidden knowledge of massive taxi trajectory data within a city. This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information. Consequently, the movement of each taxi is studied as a document consisting of the taxi traversed street names, which enables semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques. The taxi topics reflect urban mobility patterns and trends, which are displayed and analyzed through a visual analytics system. The system integrates interactive visualization tools, including taxi topic maps, topic routes, street clouds and parallel coordinates, to visualize the probability-based topical information. Urban planners, administration, travelers, and drivers can conduct their various knowledge discovery tasks with direct semantic and visual assists. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by case studies using a large taxi trajectory data set acquired from 21, 360 taxis in a city.",Ding Chu;David A.

20,2014,6787162,FiberScout: An Interactive Tool for Exploring and Analyzing Fiber Reinforced Polymers,"Advanced composites such as fiber reinforced polymers are promising candidate materials for future components as they allow integrating the continuously rising demands of industry regarding cost-effectiveness, function-orientation, integration and weight. The most important structures of fiber reinforced polymers are the individual fibers, as their characteristics (stiffness, strength, ductility, durability, etc.) to a large extent determine the properties of the final component. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new system for interactive exploration and visual analysis of fiber properties in X-ray computed tomography data of fiber reinforced polymers. The presented tool uses parallel coordinates to define and configure initial fiber classes. Using a scatter plot matrix linked to the parallel coordinates the initial classification may be refined. This allows to analyze hidden relationships between individual fiber properties. 2D and 3D views depict the resulting fiber classifications. By using polar plots an intuitive rendering of the fiber orientation distribution is provided. In addition, two modules of higher abstraction are proposed: The Blob visualization creates a hull around fibers with similar characteristics. The fiber metadata visualization allows to calculate overlays for 2D and 3D views containing regional information of particular material characteristics. The proposed system has been evaluated by two groups of domain experts. Applying the presented concepts the user feedback shows that the domain experts are now able to efficiently perform tasks as classification of fibers, visualization of fiber lengths and orientations, and visualization of fiber regions.

23,2014,6787165,Revisiting Crisis Maps with Geo-temporal Tag Visualization,"Crowd sourced crisis mapping is a relatively new phenomenon and platform that enables the collection and visualization of real-time crisis data submitted by users through social media tools and cellular technologies. Crisis maps are generally used by both state and non-state actors for sense-making and as a reference point for action. The current crisis map visualizations only show the location from which documents such as reports or short messages have been generated. Such a limited representation fails to immediately show important content, such as themes from a document and their changes over time. As a result, sense-making becomes time-consuming and cognitively demanding. We present a new visualization approach, Geo-Temporal Tag Visualization (GTViz), which treats the tags on the crowd sourced reports as spatio-temporal textual datasets. GTViz embeds a map to represent the spatial properties of the dataset and compactly shows the changes of key terms from the data source over time.

Thus not only more movements of people are tracked but also POI (point of interest) information becomes available in increasing geo-spatial density. To enable analysis of movement behavior, we present an approach to enrich trajectory data with semantic POI information and show how additional insights can be gained. Using a density-based clustering technique we extract 1.215 frequent destinations of ~150.000 user movements from a large e-mobility database. We query available context information from Foursquare, a popular location-based social network, to enrich the destinations with semantic background. As GPS measurements can be noisy, often more then one possible destination is found and movement patterns vary over time. Therefore we present highly interactive visualizations that enable an analyst to cope with the inherent geospatial and behavioral uncertainties.",Robert Krueger;Dennis Thom;Thomas Ertl,"Inst. for Visualization & Interactive Syst.

26,2014,6787168,Efficient Range Distribution Query for Visualizing Scientific Data,"Visualization applications implicitly run queries on the data to retrieve distributions and statistical measures derivable from distributions. Distribution based data summaries can substitute for the raw data to answer statistical queries of different kinds. However, frequent access to the raw data is no longer practical, if possible at all, for answering large number of queries on large-scale data. Our work addresses the issue by accelerating range distribution query, which returns the distribution of an axis-aligned query region. Maintaining the interactivity of such query is a challenging task because the workload and the response time of such queries scale up with the data and the query size. In this paper, we present a framework for answering range distribution queries for any arbitrary region in near constant time, regardless of data and query size. We adapt an integral histogram based data structure to bound the workload which is a combination of computation, I/O and communication cost. We propose two novel transformations of this data structure -- a decomposition and a similarity-driven indexing -- to reduce the huge storage cost associated with it. In addition to studying the performance of range distribution query, we also demonstrate the benefits that our technique offers to visualization applications which directly or indirectly require distributions.",Abon Chaudhuri; Tzu Hsuan Wei; Teng Yok Lee; Han Wei Shen;Tom Peterka,"Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA;Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA;Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA;Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH, USA;Argonne National Laboratory",Histograms;Indexing;Data visualization;Time factors;Three-dimensional displays;Electronic mail;Approximation methods,24,994780;4015490;994780;4015490;5473228;6064965;128028;4775894;729588;6378978;1703376;6596132;5453366;5742374;1467353;4270223;6092313;5613461;1055714,6,7539561;7192664;7348071,US;US;US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,2014,6787169,Multidimensional Projection with Radial Basis Function and Control Points Selection,"Multidimensional projection techniques provide an appealing approach for multivariate data analysis, for their ability to translate high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional representation that preserves neighborhood information. In recent years, pushed by the ever increasing data complexity in many areas, numerous advances in such techniques have been observed, primarily in terms of computational efficiency and support for interactive applications. Both these achievements were made possible due to the introduction of the concept of control points, which are used in many different multidimensional projection techniques. However, little attention has been drawn towards the process of control points selection. In this work we propose a novel multidimensional projection technique based on radial basis functions (RBF). Our method uses RBF to create a function that maps the data into a low-dimensional space by interpolating the previously calculated position of control points. We also present a built-in method for the control points selection based on ""forward-selection"" and ""Orthogonal Least Squares"" techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed selection process allows our technique to work with only a few control points while retaining the projection quality and avoiding redundant control points.",Elisa Amorim;Emilio Vital Brazil;Luis Gustavo Nonato;Faramarz Samavati;Mario Costa Sousa,"Univ. of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada;Univ. of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada;Univ. of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil;Univ. of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada;Univ. of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada",Stress;Kernel;Interpolation;Aerospace electronics;Mathematical model;Least squares approximations,28,80341;5613498;554199;1207445;4553710;4658163;6065024;1648268;4378370;5613468;1671271,5,7539398,CA;CA;BR;CA;CA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,2014,6787170,Manipulating Bilevel Feature Space for Category-Aware Image Exploration,"The demand for interactively designing the image feature space has been increasing due to the ongoing need for image retrieval, recognition, and labeling. Although conventional methods provide an interface for locally rearranging such a feature space, category-level global manipulation is still missing and thus manually rearranging the overall image categorization usually requires a time-consuming task. This paper presents a novel approach to exploring images in the database through the manipulation of bi-level feature space representations, where the upper-and lower-level representations characterize the global categories and local features of the images, respectively. In this approach, the upper-level space describes similarity relationship among the underlying categories extracted from the bag-of-features model, while the lower-level space encodes the closeness between a pair of images within the same category. The key idea behind this approach is to associate the relationship between the two feature spaces with a two-layered graph representation and project it onto 2D screen space using pivot MDS for user manipulation. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that our approach allows users to understand the entire structure of the given image dataset and reorganize the layout according to their preference both locally and globally.",Kazuyo Mizuno; Hsiang Yun Wu;Shigeo Takahashi,"Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",Visualization;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Vectors;Semantics;Histograms;Aerospace electronics,29,5613466;5613466;6327294;4432620;5539991;4553710;6065024;790410;6065013;1238663;5297746,4,7465263,JP;JP;JP,,,,,,,,,,,,,

31,2014,6787173,A New Type of Web Graph for Personalized Visualization,"Over the past few years, research on web information visualization is focusing on how to present the web information to end users effectively and efficiently. Nevertheless, with increasing size of the information in the web-space, it has become very difficult to visualize information and the inherent relationships among the information. Because of web graphs being messy and large, end users need to allow extra effort to mine interested information from those. Existing web graphs produce relationships among nodes (URLs) based on structural linkage information. As a result, by producing similar visualization to different end users, this approach lacks effectiveness considering diversity of users' need. In our work, we encounter this issue of personalization in visualization of web graph. We propose a different web graph which capitalizes on user interests to develop relationships among nodes of the web graph.

34,2014,6787176,Bridging the Gap of Network Management and Anomaly Detection through Interactive Visualization,"Large-scale networks have become increasingly challenging to manage. It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool.

38,2014,6787180,A Stochastic Approach for Rendering Multiple Irregular Volumes,"In this paper, we propose a technique for rendering multiple irregular volumes using a stochastic approach. In this approach, we extend our stochastic projected tetrahedral (SPT) algorithm to treat irregular volumes. The SPT algorithm is a sorting-free volume rendering algorithm that projects a tetrahedral cell onto an image plane and controls the particle rendering using the opacity as the probability in the rasterization process. In the rasterization process, the particle depth is determined as that of a pre-defined location, which may be the front, back or middle point on a ray segment in the SPT algorithm. This determination causes a prominent artifact when treating multiple volumes, although it does not cause any problem when treating a single volume. The artifact occurs because the SPT algorithm controls the particle stochastically in the image plane but not in the depth direction. In the volume rendering process, it is assumed that the number of particles follows a Poisson distribution along the segment of the viewing ray that intersects the tetrahedral cell. The particle spacing follows the exponential distribution. In this case, we construct a cumulative distribution function of the particle spacing and develop a technique for calculating the nearest particle along the interval. We apply this technique to multiple volumes to confirm its effectiveness.",Naohisa Sakamoto;Koji Koyamada,"Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan;Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan",Rendering (computer graphics);Mathematical model;Equations;Visualization;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Data visualization,9,4126230;4126230;6495815;1372176,1,,JP;JP,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For visualizing such kind of large-scale dataset, reducing the data size by using compression methods is one of the most useful approach. Moreover, parallelization of compression algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency and resolve the limitation of memory size. However, in parallel compression algorithm, interprocessor communication is indispensable, while it is also a bottleneck problem, especially for the general cases that the number of processors is not power-of-two. Parallel POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) compression algorithm is such an example, the number of time steps must be power-of-two for the binary swap scheme. A method that can fully resolve this problem with low computational cost will be very popular. In this paper, we proposed such an approach called 2-3-4 combination approach, which can be simply implemented and also reach high performance of parallel computing algorithms. Furthermore, our method can obtain the best balance among all parallel computing processors.

45,2014,6787187,Visual Analysis of Habitat Suitability Index Model for Predicting the Locations of Fishing Grounds,"In this study, we propose a novel integrated visualization system that enables interactive visual development of a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model for predicting the locations of fishing grounds. Our system enables the interactive selection of variables that are highly correlated to fish catches recorded by fishermen on their vessels. We illustrate the use of this system using a real-world simulation of the Pacific Ocean. Vortex structures, such as those used for fishing grounds exploration, are crucial for exploring fishing ground because they can drive nutrients from the ocean floor to the sea surface. The ability to locate fishing grounds therefore depends on accurate ocean forecasting systems for calculating ocean model variables such as temperature, salinity, velocity etc. Currently, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations that produce multidimensional and multivariate results. Critical points in the ocean model are good indicators of the likelihood of finding microscale vortices, and our visualization approach enables the interactive exploration and analysis of these critical points. The proposed system makes it possible to analyze the vortex structure in the spatial domain, and explore fishing grounds on the sea surface in detail.",Takashi Uenaka;Naohisa Sakamoto;Koji Koyamada,"Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan;Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan;Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan",Mathematical model;Silicon;Equations;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Data visualization,10,745333;175773,4,,JP;JP;JP,,,,,,,,,,,,,

47,2014,6787189,Traffic Origins: A Simple Visualization Technique to Support Traffic Incident Analysis,"Traffic incidents such as road accidents and vehicle breakdowns are a major source of travel uncertainty and delay, but the mechanism by which they cause heavy traffic is not fully understood. Traffic management controllers are tasked with routing repair and clean up crews to clear the incident and often have to do so under time pressure and with imperfect information. To aid their decision making and help them understand how past incidents affected traffic, we propose Traffic Origins, a simple method to visualize the impact road incidents have on congestion. Just before a traffic incident occurs, we mark the incident location with an expanding circle to uncover the underlying traffic flow map and when it ends, the circle recedes. This not only directs attention to upcoming events, but also allows us to observe the impact traffic incidents have on vehicle flow in the immediate vicinity and the cascading effect multiple incidents can have on a road network. We illustrate this technique using road incident and traffic flow data from Singapore.",Afian Anwar;Till Nagel;Carlo Ratti,Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab Massachusetts Institute of Technology;Interaction Design Lab University of Applied Sciences Potsdam;Senseable City Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Roads;Data visualization;Accidents;Real-time systems;Vehicles;Electric breakdown;Visualization,14,4272047;4272047;5211551;5211552,14,7463801;7364125;7120975;7344850,US;DE;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Making sense of the archived messages can be a good way to understand how things evolved and progressed in the past. Although much work has been devoted to email visualization, most work has focused on presenting one of the two aspects of email archives: discovering the evolution of emails and events, or the relationship between the email owner and his/her contacts over time. In this paper, we present Email Map, an email visualization which integrates the information of both events and contacts into a single view, enabling users to make sense of their email archives with complementary contextual information. Two visualization components are designed to portray complex information within the email archives: event flow and contact tracks.

We proposes a new method that embeds a high-dimensional 3D fiber model as a continuous map in a 2D normalized space, built on fibers from all targeted fiber models. One advantage over previous 2D embedding approaches is that our method represents all fiber models in a unified coordinate system by taking a cluster-and-project routine, ensuring that closely located fibers from different models will be projected to close points on the 2D map. Using this projected 2D map, subtle differences that are difficult to distinguish in 3D space can be clearly displayed and individual fiber model can be effectively summarized.

1,2015,7156349,Interactive streamline exploration and manipulation using deformation,"Occlusion presents a major challenge in visualizing 3D flow fields using streamlines. Displaying too many streamlines creates a dense visualization filled with occluded structures, but displaying too few streams risks losing important features. A more ideal streamline exploration approach is to visually manipulate the cluttered streamlines by pulling visible layers apart and revealing the hidden structures underneath. This paper presents a customized deformation algorithm and an interactive visualization tool to minimize visual cluttering. The algorithm is able to maintain the overall integrity of the flow field and expose the previously hidden structures. Our system supports both mouse and direct-touch interactions to manipulate the viewing perspectives and visualize the streamlines in depth.

The dendrogram has a classical node-link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix interactive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the relationship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results.",Renaud Blanch;R?my Dautriche;Gilles Bisson,"Univ.

We first detect major communities in a network using data mining and community analysis methods. Then, the statistics attributes of each community, the relational strength between communities, and the boundary nodes connecting those communities are computed and stored. We propose a novel method based on Voronoi treemap to encode each community with a polygon and the relative positions of polygons encode their relational strengths. Different community attributes can be encoded by polygon shapes, sizes and colors. A corner-cutting method is further introduced to adjust the smoothness of polygons based on certain community attribute. To accommodate the boundary nodes, the gaps between the polygons are widened by a polygon-shrinking algorithm such that the boundary nodes can be conveniently embedded into the newly created spaces. The method is very efficient, enabling users to test different community detection algorithms, fine tune the results, and explore the fuzzy relations between communities interactively.

However, node-link diagrams quickly appear cluttered and unclear, even for moderately sized graphs. If the positions of the nodes are fixed then suitable link routing is the only option to reduce clutter. We present a novel link clustering and routing algorithm which respects (and if desired refines) user-defined clusters on links. If no clusters are defined a priori we cluster based on geometric criteria, that is, based on a well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD).We route link clusters individually on a sparse visibility spanner. To completely avoid ambiguity we draw each individual link and ensure that clustered links follow the same path in the routing graph. We prove that the clusters induced by the WSPD consist of compatible links according to common similarity measures as formalized by Holten and van Wijk [17]. The greedy sparsification of the visibility graph allows us to easily route around obstacles. Our experimental results are visually appealing and convey a sense of abstraction and order.",Quirijn W.

In this work, based on taxi GPS data, we propose OD-Wheel, a novel visual design and associated analysis tool, to explore OD patterns. Once users define a region, all taxi trips starting from or ending to that region are selected and grouped into OD clusters. With a hybrid circular-linear visual design, OD-Wheel allows users to explore the dynamic patterns of each OD cluster, including the variation of traffic flow volume and traveling time.

The dimensions placed on the circumference of a circle, called Dimension Anchors (DAs), can be reordered to reveal different patterns in the dataset. Extending the number of dimensions can enhance the flexibility in the placement of the DAs to explore more meaningful visualizations. In this paper, we describe a method which rationally extends a dimension to multiple new dimensions in Radviz. This method first calculates the probability distribution histogram of a dimension. The mean shift algorithm is applied to get centers of probability density to segment the histogram, and then the dimension can be extended according to the number of segments of the histogram. We also suggest using the Dunn's index to find the optimal placement of DAs, so the better effect of visual clustering could be achieved after the dimension expansion in Radviz.

In series production, many parts are controlled in various ways in some or all stages of assembly. While tactile measurements are mostly restricted to the points on an inspection plan, this restriction does not apply to optical measurements. We propose a method based on the theory of Pareto sets (multivariate topological analysis) to cope with the large amount of data produced by optical measurements and to find points of interest on the measured surface in addition to the inspection plan.

Due to complex flow behaviours involving stretching, shearing, and folding, straightforward mesh-based representations of these surfaces can develop artefacts and degenerate quickly. Common counter-measures rely on refinement and adaptive insertion of new particles which lead to an unpredictable increase in memory requirements. We propose a novel time surface extraction technique that keeps the number of required flow particles constant, while providing a high level of fidelity and enabling straightforward load balancing. Our solution implements a 2D particle relaxation procedure that makes use of local surface metric tensors to model surface deformations. We combine this with an accurate bicubic surface representation to provide an artefact-free surface visualisation.

However, blindly mapping the ray casting algorithm on a GPU's complex parallel architecture can result in a magnitude of performance loss. In this paper, a novel computation-to-core mapping strategy, called Warp Marching, for the texture-based iso-surface volume rendering is introduced. We evaluate and compare this new strategy with the most commonly used existing mapping strategy. Texture cache performance and load balancing are the two major evaluation factors since they have significant consequences on the overall rendering performance. Through a series of real-life data experiments, we conclude that the texture cache performances of these two computation-to-core mapping strategies are significantly affected by the viewing direction; and the Warp Marching performs better in balancing workloads among threads and concurrent hardware components of a GPU.",Junpeng Wang;Fei Yang;Yong Cao,"Virginia Tech, USA;NVIDIA, USA;Virginia Tech, USA",Graphics processing units;Standards;Rendering (computer graphics);Instruction sets;Load management;Hardware;Casting,17,1309273,0,,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the data sets resulting from mobile measurements are complex: They are spatially dependent, multivariate, and often-times multitemporal. At the same time, the spatial context of each observation - its field of view and area represented - is physically complex and dynamic. These properties make analysis and visualization challenging. We present a prototype visualization framework that assists researchers in the analysis of mobile transect measurements. The system enables users to visualize and explore observations as walls that delineate the transect route on a map. The observed attributes are stacked upon each other within these walls as ribbons to facilitate the qualitative analysis of spatial variability and multivariate correlations. The relationship between observations and spatial context can interactively be explored by moving a slider along the transect route. For each observation on the track, the spatially contextual source area is displayed and linked to a view of the fraction of land cover classes contained within the source area. These qualitative analysis capabilities are complemented by an interactive clustering interface, which allows for the classification of transect segments according to a coherent pattern of multivariate relationships between a user-defined set of observations.

The proposed work flow is designed to analyze unit cells of CFRP materials integrating the recurring weaving pattern. It is designed to handle XCT scans of low resolution, in which individual fibers are not visible or are barely visible. First, a coarse version of integral curves is used to trace subsections of the individual fiber bundles in the woven CFRP materials. We call these sections MetaTracts. In the second step, these extracted fiber bundle sections (MetaTracts) are clustered using a two-step approach: first by orientation, then by proximity.

Existing labeling methods fail to help users quickly gain an overview of visualized data when the number of labels is large. Visual clutter is a major challenge preventing these methods from being applied to real-world applications. To address this, we propose a context-aware label layout that can measure and reduce visual clutter during the layout process. Our method formulates the clutter model using four factors: confusion, visual connection, distance, and intersection. Based on this clutter model, an effective clutter-aware labeling method has been developed that can generate clear and legible label layouts in different visualizations.

32,2015,7156380,Uncertainty modeling and error reduction for pathline computation in time-varying flow fields,"When the spatial and temporal resolutions of a time-varying simulation become very high, it is not possible to process or store data from every time step due to the high computation and storage cost. Although using uniformly down-sampled data for visualization is a common practice, important information in the un-stored data can be lost. Currently, linear interpolation is a popular method used to approximate data between the stored time steps. For pathline computation, however, errors from the interpolated velocity in the time dimension can accumulate quickly and make the trajectories rather unreliable. To inform the scientist the error involved in the visualization, it is important to quantify and display the uncertainty, and more importantly, to reduce the error whenever possible. In this paper, we present an algorithm to model temporal interpolation error, and an error reduction scheme to improve the data accuracy for temporally down-sampled data. We show that it is possible to compute polynomial regression and measure the interpolation errors incrementally with one sequential scan of the time-varying flow field. We also show empirically that when the data sequence is fitted with least-squares regression, the errors can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution. With the end positions of particle traces stored, we show that our error modeling scheme can better estimate the intermediate particle trajectories between the stored time steps based on a maximum likelihood method that utilizes forward and backward particle traces.",Chun-Ming Chen;Ayan Biswas;Han-Wei Shen,"The Ohio State University, USA;The Ohio State University, USA;The Ohio State University, USA",Mathematical model;Interpolation;Computational modeling;Uncertainty;Polynomials;Gaussian distribution;Data models,21,6378985;4447667;6327234;5611509;1231171;1438260;5307638;5742374;6092313,8,7348070;7465273,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, vortices are global features, which present challenges for local detectors. On the other hand, global detectors are computationally intensive and require considerable user input. In this work, we propose a consensus-based uncertainty model and introduce spatial proximity to enhance vortex detection results obtained using point-based methods. We use four existing local vortex detectors and convert their outputs into fuzzy possibility values using a sigmoid-based soft-thresholding approach. We apply a majority voting scheme that enables us to identify candidate vortex regions with a higher degree of confidence. Then, we introduce spatial proximity- based analysis to discern the final vortical regions. Thus, by using spatial proximity coupled with fuzzy inputs, we propose a novel uncertainty analysis approach for vortex detection. We use expert's input to better estimate the system parameters and results from two real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our method.",Ayan Biswas;David Thompson; Wenbin He;Qi Deng; Chun-Ming Chen; Han-Wei Shenk;Raghu Machiraju;Anand Rangarajan,"The Ohio State University, USA;Mississippi State University, USA;The Ohio State University, USA;University of Florida, USA;The Ohio State University, USA;The Ohio State University, USA;The Ohio State University, USA;University of Florida, USA",Detectors;Uncertainty;Entropy;Tensile stress;Robustness;Electronic mail;Data visualization,37,468404;4632831;468404;4632831;4408059;5290745;1238242;1183789;5582086;6634153;4302576;809917;809896;745296;745333;1014977;1372196;4376212,5,7192689;7192711,US;US;US;US;US;US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,2015,7156382,Efficient volume illumination with multiple light sources through selective light updates,"Incorporating volumetric illumination into rendering of volumetric data increases visual realism, which can lead to improved spatial comprehension. It is known that spatial comprehension can be further improved by incorporating multiple light sources. However, many volumetric illumination algorithms have severe drawbacks when dealing with multiple light sources. These drawbacks are mainly high performance penalties and memory usage, which can be tackled with specialized data structures or data under sampling. In contrast, in this paper we present a method which enables volumetric illumination with multiple light sources without requiring precomputation or impacting visual quality. To achieve this goal, we introduce selective light updates which minimize the required computations when light settings are changed. We will discuss and analyze the novel concepts underlying selective light updates, and demonstrate them when applied to real-world data under different light settings.",Erik Sund?n;Timo Ropinski,"Interactive Visualization Group, Link?ping University, Sweden;Visual Computing Research Group, Ulm University, Germany",Light sources;Lighting;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization;Solid modeling;Photography;Color,35,6875905;729583;6875905;729583;1250395;6327241;1196003;5710905;6064955;468400;5560616;6064942;1250394;6064977;6175015;135913;6461883;6634193,2,7534852,SE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,2015,7156383,Advanced lighting for unstructured-grid data visualization,"The benefits of using advanced illumination models in volume visualization have been demonstrated by many researchers. Interactive volume rendering incorporated with advanced lighting has been achieved with GPU acceleration for regular-grid volume data, making volume visualization even more appealing as a tool for 3D data exploration. This paper presents an interactive illumination strategy, which is specially designed and optimized for volume visualization of unstructured-grid data. The basis of the design is a partial differential equation based illumination model to simulate the light propagation, absorption, and scattering within the volumetric medium. In particular, a two-level scheme is introduced to overcome the challenges presented by unstructured grids. Test results show that the added illumination effects such as global shadowing and multiple scattering not only lead to more visually pleasing visualization, but also greatly enhance the perception of the depth information and complex spatial relationships for features of interest in the volume data. This volume visualization enhancement is introduced at a time when unstructured grids are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of scientific simulation applications.",Min Shih;Yubo Zhang; Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California, Davis, USA;University of California, Davis, USA;University of California, Davis, USA",Lighting;Rendering (computer graphics);Light sources;Scattering;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Data visualization,29,6875905;6634150;6875905;6634150;1183767;885680;5262940;6327241;1183764;1196003;468400;5429594;885683;6064942;6361390;1250390,1,,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animation artists apply sophisticated illustration techniques to communicate a story, while trying to maintain a realistic representation of a complex dynamic environment. Since such hand-crafted animations are time-consuming and cost-intensive to create, our goal is to formalize illustration techniques used by artists to facilitate the automatic creation of visualizations generated from mesoscale particle-based molecular simulations. Our technique Illustrative Timelapse supports visual exploration of complex biochemical processes in dynamic environments by (1) seamless temporal zooming to observe phenomena in different temporal resolutions, (2) visual abstraction of molecular trajectories to ensure that observers are able to visually follow the main actors, (3) increased visual focus on events of interest, and (4) lens effects to preserve a realistic representation of the environment in the context. Results from a first user study indicate that visual abstraction of trajectories improves the ability to follow a story and is also appreciated by users.

37,2015,7156385,Coverage-based opacity estimation for interactive Depth of Field in molecular visualization,"In this paper, we introduce coverage-based opacity estimation to achieve Depth of Field (DoF) effects when visualizing molecular dynamics (MD) data. The proposed algorithm is a novel object-based approach which eliminates many of the shortcomings of state-of-the-art image-based DoF algorithms. Based on observations derived from a physically-correct reference renderer, coverage-based opacity estimation exploits semi-transparency to simulate the blur inherent to DoF effects. It achieves high quality DoF effects, by augmenting each atom with a semi-transparent shell, which has a radius proportional to the distance from the focal plane of the camera. Thus, each shell represents an additional coverage area whose opacity varies radially, based on our observations derived from the results of multi-sampling DoF algorithms. By using the proposed technique, it becomes possible to generate high quality visual results, comparable to those achieved through ground-truth multi-sampling algorithms. At the same time, we obtain a significant speedup which is essential for visualizing MD data as it enables interactive rendering. In this paper, we derive the underlying theory, introduce coverage-based opacity estimation and demonstrate how it can be applied to real world MD data in order to achieve DoF effects. We further analyze the achieved results with respect to performance as well as quality and show that they are comparable to images generated with modern distributed ray tracing engines.",Sathish Kottravel;Martin Falk;Erik Sund?n;Timo Ropinski,"Interactive Visualization Group, Link?ping University, Sweden;Interactive Visualization Group, Link?ping University, Sweden;Interactive Visualization Group, Link?ping University, Sweden;Visual Computing Research Group, Ulm University, Germany",Lenses;Apertures;Atomic measurements;Rendering (computer graphics);Cameras;Estimation;Data visualization,24,6596131;963286;4641923;5571280,6,7192702;7539643;7429514,SE;SE;SE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

40,2015,7156388,Ray tracing within a data parallel framework,"Current architectural trends on supercomputers have dramatic increases in the number of cores and available computational power per die, but this power is increasingly difficult for programmers to harness effectively. High-level language constructs can simplify programming many-core devices, but this ease comes with a potential loss of processing power, particularly for cross-platform constructs. Recently, scientific visualization packages have embraced language constructs centering around data parallelism, with familiar operators such as map, reduce, gather, and scatter. Complete adoption of data parallelism will require that central visualization algorithms be revisited, and expressed in this new paradigm while preserving both functionality and performance. This investment has a large potential payoff: portable performance in software bases that can span over the many architectures that scientific visualization applications run on. With this work, we present a method for ray tracing consisting of entirely of data parallel primitives. Given the extreme computational power on nodes now prevalent on supercomputers, we believe that ray tracing can supplant rasterization as the work-horse graphics solution for scientific visualization. Our ray tracing method is relatively efficient, and we describe its performance with a series of tests, and also compare to leading-edge ray tracers that are optimized for specific platforms. We find that our data parallel approach leads to results that are acceptable for many scientific visualization use cases, with the key benefit of providing a single code base that can run on many architectures.",Matthew Larsen;Jeremy S.

If relying too much on effective enhancements in manual interventions, the associated results depend heavily on the knowledge and skills of users performing the data analysis. This paper presents a novel approach to extracting feature subspaces from multivariate data by incorporating biclustering techniques. The approach has been maximally automated in the sense that highly-correlated dimensions are automatically grouped to form subspaces, which effectively supports further exploration of them. A key idea behind our approach lies in a new mathematical formulation of asymmetric biclustering, by combining spherical k-means clustering for grouping highly-correlated dimensions, together with ordinary k-means clustering for identifying subsets of data samples. Lower-dimensional representations of data in feature subspaces are successfully visualized by parallel coordinate plot, where we project the data samples of correlated dimensions to one composite axis through dimensionality reduction schemes.

In this paper, we first unify the various data layout schemes and choose the Generalized Bary-centric Coordinates (GBC) plot as the standard way to describe them. Second, we propose three algorithms - distance spaced lay-out, iterative error reduction, and force directed adjustment - to reduce the layout error of variables to variables, data to variables and data to data, respectively. We find that the combination of these three algorithms can yield large improvements in the layout error and so achieve a more comprehensive layout.

TrajRank first allows users to interactively select a route, and segment it into several road segments. Then trajectories passing this route are automatically extracted. These trajectories are ranked on each road segment according to travel time and further clustered according to the rankings on all road segments.

Arc length based aspect ratio selection (AL) has demonstrated many empirical advantages over previous methods. However, it is still not clear why and when this method works. In this paper, we attempt to unravel its mystery by exploring its mathematical foundation. First, we explain the rationale why this method is parameterization invariant and follow the same rationale to extend previous methods which are not parameterization invariant. As such, we propose maximizing weighted local curvature (MLC), a parameterization invariant form of local orientation resolution (LOR) and reveal the theoretical connection between average slope (AS) and resultant vector (RV). Furthermore, we establish a mathematical connection between AL and banking to 45 degrees and derive the upper and lower bounds of its average absolute slopes. Finally, we conduct a quantitative comparison that revises the understanding of aspect ratio selection methods in three aspects: (1) showing that AL, AWO and RV always perform very similarly while MS is not; (2) demonstrating the advantages in the robustness of RV over AL; (3) providing a counterexample where all previous methods produce poor results while MLC works well.",Fubo Han;Yunhai Wang;Jian Zhang;Oliver Deussen;Baoquan Chen,"Shandong University;Shandong University;CNIC, CAS;University of Konstanz, SIAT;Shandong University",Banking;Robustness;Market research;Visual perception;Visualization;Indexes;Computers,17,6634178;5613429;149591;6064993;6327267,0,,CN;CN;CN;DE;CN,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is applicable, for example, to describe persons' affiliations to different social groups or their association with subjects such as topics of interest. In these applications, it is important to understand the connectivity patterns among the entities in the bipartite graph. For the example of a bipartite relation between persons and their topics of interest, people may form groups based on their common interests, and the topics also can be grouped or categorized based on the interested audiences. Co-clustering methods can identify such connectivity patterns and find clusters within the two types of entities simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an interactive visualization design that incorporates co-clustering methods to facilitate the identification of node clusters formed by their common connections in a bipartite graph. Besides highlighting the automatically detected node clusters and the connections among them, the visual interface also provides visual cues for evaluating the homogeneity of the bipartite connections in a cluster, identifying potential outliers, and analyzing the correlation of node attributes with the cluster structure. The interactive visual interface allows users to flexibly adjust the node grouping to incorporate their prior knowledge of the domain, either by direct manipulation (i.e., splitting and merging the clusters), or by providing explicit feedback on the cluster quality, based on which the system will learn a parametrization of the co-clustering algorithm to better align with the users' notion of node similarity.

Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research.

9,2016,7465252,Rethinking sensitivity analysis of nuclear simulations with topology,"In nuclear engineering, understanding the safety margins of the nuclear reactor via simulations is arguably of paramount importance in predicting and preventing nuclear accidents. It is therefore crucial to perform sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in the model inputs affect the outputs. Modern nuclear simulation tools rely on numerical representations of the sensitivity information - inherently lacking in visual encodings - offering limited effectiveness in communicating and exploring the generated data. In this paper, we design a framework for sensitivity analysis and visualization of multidimensional nuclear simulation data using partition-based, topology-inspired regression models and report on its efficacy. We rely on the established Morse-Smale regression technique, which allows us to partition the domain into monotonic regions where easily interpretable linear models can be used to assess the influence of inputs on the output variability. The underlying computation is augmented with an intuitive and interactive visual design to effectively communicate sensitivity information to nuclear scientists. Our framework is being deployed into the multipurpose probabilistic risk assessment and uncertainty quantification framework RAVEN (Reactor Analysis and Virtual Control Environment). We evaluate our framework using a simulation dataset studying nuclear fuel performance.",Dan Maljovec;Bei Wang;Paul Rosen;Andrea Alfonsi;Giovanni Pastore;Cristian Rabiti;Valerio Pascucci,"SCI Institute, University of Utah;SCI Institute, University of Utah;University of South Florida;Idaho National Laboratory;Idaho National Laboratory;Idaho National Laboratory;SCI Institute, University of Utah",Sensitivity analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Data visualization;Visualization,50,4677368;4677368;5652460;6464263;6064948;4658140;892133;5613467;6102450;6102448;6634169;4269947,2,,US;US;US;US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,2016,7465253,Topology-inspired Galilean invariant vector field analysis,"Vector field topology is one of the most powerful flow visualization tools, because it can break down huge amounts of data into a compact, sparse, and easy to read description with little information loss. It suffers from one main drawback though: The definition of critical points, which is the foundation of vector field topology, is highly dependent on the frame of reference. In this paper we propose to consider every point as a critical point and locally adjust the frame of reference to the most persistent ones, that means the extrema of the determinant of the Jacobian. The result is not the extraction of one well-suited frame of reference, but the simultaneous visualization of the dominating frames of reference in the different areas of the flow field. Each of them could individually be perceived by an observer traveling along these critical points. We show all important ones at once.",Roxana Bujack;Mario Hlawitschka;Kenneth I.

By taking longer access sequences into account to model more sophisticated data access patterns in particle tracing, our method greatly improves the accuracy and reliability in data access prediction. In our work, high-order access dependencies are calculated by tracing uniformly seeded pathlines in both forward and backward directions in a preprocessing stage. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a parallel particle tracing framework with high-order data prefetching.

12,2016,7465255,Comparative visualization of multiple time surfaces by planar surface reformation,"Comparing time surfaces at different integration time points, or from different seeding areas, can provide valuable insight into transport phenomena of fluid flows. Such a comparative study is challenging due to the often convoluted shapes of these surfaces. We propose a new approach for comparative flow visualization based on time surfaces, which exploits the idea of embedding the surfaces in a carefully designed, reformed 2D visualization space. Such an embedding enables new opportunities for comparative flow visualization. We present three different strategies for comparative flow visualization that take advantage of the reformation. By reforming the time surfaces, we not only mitigate occlusion issues, but we can devote also the third dimension of the visualization space to the comparative aspects of the visualization. Our approach is effective in a variety of flow study cases. The direct comparison of individual time surfaces reveals small scale differences and fine details about the fluid's motion. The concurrent study of multiple surface families enables the identification and the comparison of the most prominent motion patterns.

By measuring how many common blocks the ensemble pathlines pass through, the LCSS distance defines the similarity among vector field ensembles by counting the number of shared domain data blocks. Compared with traditional methods (e.g., pointwise Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping distance), the proposed approach is robust to outliers, missing data, and the sampling rate of the pathline timesteps. Taking advantage of smaller and reusable intermediate output, visualization based on the proposed LCSS approach reveals temporal trends in the data at low storage cost and avoids tracing pathlines repeatedly.

Current tools and techniques for extracting these structural features are sensitive to uncertainties in atomic position and radii. In this paper, we study the problem of cavity extraction in biomolecules while taking into account such uncertainties. We propose an approach that connects user-specified cavities by computing an optimal conduit within the region occupied by the molecule. The conduit is computed using a topological representation of the occupied and empty regions and is guaranteed to satisfy well defined geometric optimality criteria. Visualization of the set of all cavities with multiple linked views serves as a useful interface for interactive extraction of stable cavities.

15,2016,7465258,Accelerated visualization of transparent molecular surfaces in molecular dynamics,"The reactivity of the biomolecular structures is highly influenced by their structural features. Thus, studying these features along with the exploration of their dynamic behavior helps to understand the processes ongoing in living cells. This can be reached by the visual representation of these processes as visualization is one of the most natural ways to convey such information. However, none of the currently available techniques provides the biochemists with an intuitive real-time representation of the dynamic movements of molecules and precise geometrical based extraction of their structural features performed instantly. In this paper we introduce such a technique enabling the user to compute and also to visualize the molecular surface along with inner voids. To obtain a better insight into the molecule, our technique enables to visualize the molecular surface transparently. The opacity can be adjusted by changing user-defined parameters in order to enhance the perception of the surfaces of inner voids. All integrated algorithms run in real-time which gives the user a big variety of exploration possibilities. The importance of our approach is even amplified with respect to the fact that currently the size of molecular dynamics simulations is increasing dramatically and offline rendering thus becomes impracticable.

16,2016,7465259,Interactive exploration of atomic trajectories through relative-angle distribution and associated uncertainties,"Exploration of atomic trajectories is fundamental to understanding and characterizing complex chemical systems important in many applications. For instance, any new insight into the mechanisms of ionic migration in catalytic materials could lead to a substantial increase in battery performance. A new statistical measure, called the relative-angle distribution, has been proposed to understand complex motion - whether Brownian, ballistic, or diffusive. The relative-angle distribution can be represented as a collection of 1D histograms, but is currently created in a slow, offline process, making any parameter exploration a tedious and time-consuming task. Furthermore, the resulting plot can hide uncertainty in both the data and the visualization. As a result, once rastered or printed at a fixed resolution, these histograms can be misleading. We present a new analysis tool for the exploration of atomic trajectories that combines an interactive histogram visualization with uncertainty information for both data and plotting errors, and is also linked to an interactive 3D display of trajectories. Our tool enables a holistic exploration of trajectories previously not feasible, with the potential for significant scientific impact. In collaboration with domain experts, we have deployed our tool ta analyze molecular dynamics simulations of lithium-ion diffusion.

A visually interactive exploration of subspaces and clusters is a cyclic process. Every meaningful discovery will motivate users to re-search subspaces that can provide improved clustering results and reveal the relationships among clusters that can hardly coexist in the original subspaces. However, the combination of dimensions from the original subspaces is not always effective in finding the expected subspaces. In this study, we present an approach that enables users to reconstruct new dimensions from the data projections of subspaces to preserve interesting cluster information. The reconstructed dimensions are included into an analytical workflow with the original dimensions to help users construct target-oriented subspaces which clearly display informative cluster structures. We also provide a visualization tool that assists users in the exploration of subspace clusters by utilizing dimension reconstruction.

18,2016,7465261,A visual analytics approach to high-dimensional logistic regression modeling and its application to an environmental health study,"In the domain of epidemiology, logistic regression modeling is widely used to explain the relationships among explanatory variables and dichotomous outcome variables. However, logistic regression modeling faces challenges such as overfitting, confounding, and multicollinearity when there is a large number of explanatory variables. For example, in the birth defect study presented in this paper, variable selection for building high quality models to identify risk factors from hundreds of pollutant variables is difficult. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual analytics approach to logistic regression modeling for high-dimensional datasets. It leverages the traditional modeling pipeline by providing (1) intuitive visualizations for inspecting statistical indicators and the relationships among the variables and (2) a seamless, effective dimension reduction pipeline for selecting variables for inclusion in high quality logistic regression models. A fully working prototype of this approach has been developed and successfully applied to the birth defect study, which illustrates its effectiveness and efficiency.

Nowadays many text-based data sets, such as Flickr tags, are geo-referenced, that is, they have an important spatial component. However, existing automated methods to generate word clouds are unable to incorporate such spatial information. We introduce geo word clouds: word clouds which capture not only the frequency but also the spatial relevance of words. Our input is a set of locations from one (or more) geographic regions with (possibly several) text labels per location. We aggregate word frequencies according to point clusters and employ a greedy strategy to place appropriately sized labels without overlap as close as possible to their corresponding locations. While doing so we ""draw"" the spatial shapes of the geographic regions with the corresponding labels. We experimentally explore trade-offs concerning the location of labels, their relative sizes and the number of spatial clusters. The resulting word clouds are visually pleasing and have a low error in terms of relative scaling and locational accuracy of words, while using a small number of clusters per label.",Kevin Buchin;Daan Creemers;Andrea Lazzarotto;Bettina Speckmann;Jules Wulms,"TU Eindhoven, The Netherlands;TU Eindhoven, The Netherlands;Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy;TU Eindhoven, The Netherlands;TU Eindhoven, The Netherlands",Tag clouds;Shape;Electronic mail;Data visualization;Labeling;Spatial databases;Flickr,18,7118241;7118241;5429600;4577920;4272027;6875961;5290722,0,,NL;NL;IT;NL;NL,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the categorization process we enable the use of all available metadata, treated as multivariate data. We identified images, attributes, and categories as important aspects and integrated these in a system called ICLIC. The system consists of four views that are connected by the selection of images, which is a central action in the approach. By using a minimalist interface with only standard metaphors, users are enabled to use the system in short time. The system enables complex queries in a natural way, and it can deal with collections containing more than 100,000 images and more than 1,000 metadata attributes.

28,2016,7465271,Screen-space silhouettes for visualizing ensembles of 3D isosurfaces,"Visualizing sets of isosurfaces from 3D scalar ensemble fields is a difficult task due to inherent occlusion effects, yet it is often required to analyze the uncertainty represented by such an ensemble. In this paper, we present a novel visualization technique for ensembles of isosurfaces based on screen-space silhouettes. By using silhouettes, the displayed information is reduced to avoid occlusions, yet the major shape of the surfaces can be maintained. Our approach preserves spatial coherence and does not make any assumption about the underlying surface distribution. By providing additional mechanisms, i.e., picking, clustering, cutting and animation, we enable the user to explore an ensemble of surfaces interactively.",Ismail Demir;Johannes Kehrer;R?diger Westermann,"Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universit?t M?nchen, Germany;Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universit?t M?nchen, Germany;Computer Graphics and Visualization Group, Technische Universit?t M?nchen, Germany",Rendering (computer graphics);Three-dimensional displays;Isosurfaces;Context;Image color analysis;Clustering algorithms,48,6875958;5613488;6875990;7192675;885739;7194852;7347634;1231171;6185547;1250414;6876007;6875964;5360497;5613483;545307;6092313;6634129,1,,DE;DE;DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,2016,7465272,Visualizing the variations of ensemble of isosurfaces,"Visualizing the similarities and differences among an ensemble of isosurfaces is a challenging problem mainly because the isosurfaces cannot be displayed together at the same time. For ensemble of isosurfaces, visualizing these spatial differences among the surfaces is essential to get useful insights as to how the individual ensemble simulations affect different isosurfaces. We propose a scheme to visualize the spatial variations of isosurfaces with respect to statistically significant isosurfaces within the ensemble. Understanding such variations among ensemble of isosurfaces at different spatial regions is helpful in analyzing the influence of different ensemble runs over the spatial domain. In this regard, we propose an isosurface-entropy based clustering scheme to divide the spatial domain into regions of high and low isosurface variation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by successfully applying it on real-world ensemble data sets from ocean simulation experiments and weather forecasts.",Subhashis Hazarika;Soumya Dutta;Han-Wei Shen,"The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA;The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA;The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA",Isosurfaces;Shape;Entropy;Sea surface;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization,17,6634187;6634187;1634323;1438260;6813969;5613483;6634129,0,,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,2016,7465273,A Bayesian approach for probabilistic streamline computation in uncertain flows,"Streamline-based techniques play an important role in visualizing and analyzing uncertain steady vector fields. It is a challenging problem to generate accurate streamlines in uncertain vector fields due to the global uncertainty transportation. In this work, we present a novel probabilistic method for streamline computation on uncertain steady vector fields using a Bayesian framework. In our framework, a streamline is modeled as a state space model which captures the spatial coherence of integration steps and uncertainty in local distributions using the conditional prior density and the likelihood function. To approximate the posterior distribution for all the possible traces originating from a given seed position, a set of weighted samples are iteratively updated from which streamlines with higher likelihood can be derived. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare our method with alternative methods on different types of flow field data sets. Our method can generate possible streamlines with higher certainty and hence more accurate flow traces.",Wenbin He;Chun-Ming Chen;Xiaotong Liu;Han-Wei Shen,The Ohio State University;The Ohio State University;The Ohio State University;The Ohio State University,Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Monte Carlo methods;Probabilistic logic;Trajectory;Hidden Markov models;Density measurement,25,6051431;6051431;6378985;7156380;1398545;568116;5742374;5753894;1372187;6092313,0,,US;US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,2016,7465274,A study of using motion for comparative visualization,"While the assessment of using motion in visualizations has been polarized, we conjecture that motion may be more effective in comparative visualizations if applied properly, especially when dealing with large amounts of multi-dimensional data.

In this paper, a visual analytic tool is proposed to discover and understand individual behavior patterns in smartphone usage data. Four cooperated visualization views and many interactions are provided in this tool to visually explore the temporal features of various interactive events between smartphones and their users, the hierarchical associations among event types, and the detailed distributions of massive event sequences.

34,2016,7465277,STAC: Enhancing stacked graphs for time series analysis,"Stacked graphs have been widely used to represent multiple time series simultaneously to show the changes of individual values and their aggregation over time. However, when the number of time series becomes very large, the layers representing time series with small values take up only very small proportions in the stacked graph, making them hard to trace. As a result, it is challenging for analysts to detect the correlation of individual layers and their aggregation, and find trend similarities and differences between layers solely with stacked graphs. In this paper, we study the correlations of individual layers, and their aggregation in time series data presented with stacked graphs, focusing on the local regions within any given time intervals. Specifically, we present STAC, an interactive visual analytics system, to help analysts gain insights into the correlations in stacked graphs. While preserving the original stacked shape, we further link a stacked graph with auxiliary views to facilitate the in-depth analysis of correlations in time series data. A case study based on a real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into time series data analysis and facilitating various analytical tasks.",Yun Wang;Tongshuang Wu;Zhutian Chen;Qiong Luo;Huamin Qu,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Time series analysis;Market research;Data visualization;Visualization;Correlation;Shape;Data analysis,32,4359494;4359494;4658136;6065008;1702202;5613451;981848;5613429;6065010;6876038;6875992;1532122;7419266,1,7539294,HK;HK;HK;HK;HK,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We consider three designs for egocentric visualization: node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, and botanical trees to depict one's academic career in terms of his/her publication records. Case studies are conducted to compare the effectiveness of resulting visualizations for conveying particular aspect of a researcher's bibliographic records. Based on our study, we find that node-link diagrams are better at revealing the overall distribution of certain attributes; adjacency matrices can convey more information with less clutter; and botanical trees are visually attractive and provide the best at a glance characterization of the mapped data, but mapping data to tree features must be carefully done to derive expressive visualization.",Tsai-Ling Fung;Jia-Kai Chou;Kwan-Liu Ma,"University of California, Davis;University of California, Davis;University of California, Davis",Data visualization;Vegetation;Image color analysis;Engineering profession;Market research;Sparse matrices;Visualization,29,809927;809927;7106391;5246813;1382886;4015417;4376154;963285;7160902;7160873,0,,US;US;US,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,2016,7465280,Bookwall: Visualizing books online based on user experience in physical bookstores,"Online bookstores have highly thrived and changed consumer behaviors in these years. However, most customers go to online bookstores only when they have specific targets. One reason is that the current web interfaces are usually too complex and cluttered for users to browse. In addition, current visualization interfaces only display the results associated with a single attribute, thus requiring users to interact intensively to find their targets. Inspired by the user experiences (UX) in physical bookstores, we present Bookwall, an online bookstore interface which comprises two components: Category Map and Wall View, enabling users to find their targets more efficiently and releasing users from the burden of complicated operations. Specifically, the category map produces a map with a ""natural"" map-like look, providing an overview of the clusters and neighborhood of book categories. The wall view enables displaying query results satisfying dual query attributes simultaneously. The results show that Bookwall can provide the users a favourable alternative visualization.",Hsin-I Chen;Wei-Ting Lin;Bing-Yu Chen,National Taiwan University;National Taiwan University;National Taiwan University,Visualization;Data visualization;Layout;Navigation;Electronic mail;Psychology;Color,13,5613466;5613466;6247786;4658131;6112774;4658128,0,,TW;TW;TW,,,,,,,,,,,,,
